Narendra Modi, Federal Chancellor of Austria Christian Kern and President of Moldova Igor Dodon.</p><p> The annual St Petersburg International Economic
Forum first convened in 1997 to discuss key issues of economic development in Russia, the emerging economies and the world at large. The slogan this year is <i>Achieving a New Balance in the Global
Economic Arena</i>.</p><p><b>* * *</b></p><p><i>Excerpts
from transcript of the plenary meeting of the St Petersburg International
Economic Forum</i></p><p><b>Panel moderator, NBC
host Megyn Kelly: </b>Welcome,
everyone. Thank you so much for being here. I’m Megyn Kelly. And welcome to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum. Welcome to our distinguished
guests, to our host President Putin, and to all of you. Thank you for taking
the time to be here with us today. Yes, yes, how about it for our host and our
guests (<i>Applause</i>).</p><p>We’ve been in St Petersburg for a few days and understand that this is an important place, a personal place to President
Putin. And now we understand why. It’s incredibly beautiful. The gorgeous
rivers, romantic bridges, the beautiful weather (<i>Laughter)</i>. And most of all the lovely people who have given us such
a warm welcome and – I’ll tell you, just in our few days here – have made us
feel like we have far more in common than we do apart. And so, the world
leaders need to figure out the differences, but I think the people feel bonded
in a lovely way (<i>Applause</i>). </p><p>So today we’re going to have some opening
remarks, and then we’ll get into some questions and hopefully mix it up a little bit. And with that, I turn it over to our host, Russian President
Vladimir Putin (<i>Applause</i>). </p><p><b>President of Russia Vladimir Putin: </b>Ladies and gentlemen, friends,</p><p>It is a pleasure to welcome the participants
of the 21st St Petersburg International Economic Forum, including directors of international organisations, heads of state, government representatives and business leaders from dozens of countries.</p><p>We appreciate your interest in Russia and the dialogue that is aimed at developing partnership. We are open to cooperation,
mutually beneficial projects and working together to find solutions to the vital, strategic issues of global development.</p><p>Only by combining our efforts will we be able
to overcome current imbalances, move towards sustainable global economic development,
formulate rules for fair trade and honest competition, reduce poverty, solve acute
social issues and deal with major challenges such as terrorism, regional
conflicts and the proliferation of nationalism and xenophobia.</p><p>We are not just approaching but have already come
face to face with formidable challenges to our civilisation. The environmental
burden on the planet is growing due to human impact and natural processes.
These issues must be thoroughly researched and analysed.</p><p>We must act responsibly and coherently when formulating
our policies and joint action plans. Only in this way will we be able to implement
the necessary resolutions in the interests of harmonious global development.</p><p>I would like to add that new technologies are
rapidly changing our way of life, leading to the rise of new industries and professions and opening up new development opportunities. However, they are also
creating new threats. I know that you worked hard yesterday, holding panel
sessions and discussions where you dealt with all of this.</p><p>But I would like to repeat that we
are facing systemic, long-term challenges, the consequences of which are even
difficult to estimate and forecast at this point. So we should not, we have no
right to expend ourselves on distractions, to waste our time and energy on quarrels, strife and geopolitical games.</p><p>We need wisdom and a sense of responsibility,
a joint search for unconventional solutions, new formats of cooperation between
states, regional integration associations, business and the scientific
community.</p><p>To this end, we must make full use
of the potential of such a unique, universal organisation as the United
Nations. The UN Secretary-General is present here. I know that he came to visit
us and I would like to thank him for this. Let us welcome him.</p><p>We propose establishing a special
international youth section at the St Petersburg Economic Forum because tomorrow
is for the younger generation. They are the ones who will build the future and live in it. Participants in this section could analyse, form and shape the image of the future of their countries and civilisation as a whole.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Russia is already making a contribution to resolving global issues and is ready to do more. We are
carrying out large-scale environmental programmes, including those in the Arctic,
increasing supplies of quality food to world markets and expanding our
participation in projects of the World Health Organisation. We are ready to make
more active use of the powerful potential of Russian fundamental science to search for ways to address major challenges.</p><p>Owing to our excellent schools of mathematics
and theoretical physics, we are capable of taking the lead in a number of areas
of the so-called new economy, primarily the digital economy. Russian IT
companies are certainly competitive on a global scale. Our specialists are not
just coming up with the best, unique software solutions but are also creating a new area of knowledge, a new environment for developing the economy and life. </p><p>I would like to use this opportunity
to congratulate students of the St Petersburg University of Information
Technologies, Mechanics and Optics (ITMO), who again, for the seventh time won the international programming contest.
Our moderator spoke about the people who live in St Petersburg and she is
right. They are respectable people, and the city’s young residents are proving
this in the best way.</p><p>To build up our work force,
intellectual and technological advantages in the digital economy, we intend to take action in areas of systemic importance. What do I mean?</p><p>Firstly, it is necessary to draft an entirely new, flexible regulatory foundation for introducing digital technology
in all areas of life. Importantly, all decisions must be made with due account
of the need to ensure information security for the state, businesses and citizens.</p><p>Secondly, the state will support
those companies that bring with them developments and competencies in digital
technology and have a so-called crossover, intersectoral impact – processing
and analysis of big data, artificial intelligence and neurotechnology, and virtual and augmented reality technology, to name a few.</p><p>Thirdly, we will build support
infrastructure for the digital economy, including secure communications lines
and data processing centres with the participation of the state and businesses.
In addition, I will note that this infrastructure should be based on the most
advanced technology and developments.</p><p>Fourthly, we intend to increase many
times over the number of graduates specialising in the digital economy. In effect, we will have to resolve a broader task, a task at the national level –
to achieve universal digital literacy. To do this, it is necessary to dramatically
improve the educational system at all levels – from schools to universities.
And, of course, we should launch training programmes for people of all ages.</p><p>On my instructions, the Government
has drafted a programme for developing the digital economy. To underscore, we
must clearly determine the sources, mechanisms and scale of its funding. We
will discuss all these issues at the next meeting of the Council for Strategic
Developments and Priority Projects.</p><p>Colleagues, to reiterate, the digital
economy is not a separate industry. In fact, it is the foundation that makes it
possible to build innovative models of business, trade, logistics, and manufacturing. It has changed our approaches to education, healthcare, public
administration, and communication between people. As a result, it sets a new
paradigm for the development of the state, the economy and society as a whole.</p><p>This way of thinking will determine
how we build our economic and technical policy, industry, and infrastructure,
and form an open and free business environment, and a flexible labour market,
as well as achieve goals which will ensure long-term growth. We can already say
that a new phase of recovery has begun in our economy.</p><p>Russia's GDP is growing for the third consecutive quarter. According to preliminary estimates, the economy grew
by 1.4 percent in April. Car sales and mortgage loans are on the rise. I am
saying this because, as specialists know, experts all over the world consider
these indicators as important signs of economic recovery and growing consumer
demand.</p><p>For reference, I can tell you that car
sales rose by 2.6 percent in January-April 2017. We have almost reached
inflation benchmarks, and we expect it to be under the target figure, that is, under
4 percent, by year-end. This helps the Bank of Russia gradually cut the interest rate.</p><p>By the way, on the sidelines of the forum, international investors and business representatives have noted the high
quality of Russia’s macroeconomic policy. Yesterday we discussed this with our colleagues – representatives of major international investment funds. For them, this is a weighty argument in favour of continuing working on the Russian market.</p><p>The inflow of foreign direct investment
into the Russian economy amounted to $7 billion in the first quarter. Notably, this
is the best number for the corresponding period in the past three years. Investments
during the first quarter were up 2.3 percent overall.</p><p>I would like to note and underscore that the increase in investment is currently outpacing GDP growth, which is another sign
of what I have already mentioned: our economy is entering a new phase of growth, and the foundations for its future growth are taking shape. It is
important to support and speed up these positive trends, so as to be able to achieve economic growth rates outstripping global ones by late 2019-early 2020.</p><p>The key factor here is to increase
investment activity, primarily on the part of private businesses. We have done
a lot to update federal legislation, to remove administrative barriers, and to streamline oversight and supervision procedures and functions.</p><p>According to international experts,
Russia boasts the best dynamics internationally over the past five years when
it comes to improving its business climate. We went up 80 positions on the famous Doing Business ranking in one go.</p><p>Importantly, our regions have joined
our efforts to form an open and supportive business environment, including the Republic of Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Moscow, Tula Region, and Kaluga Region. This
year, they made it to the top of the national investment climate rankings. They
deserve our congratulations. (<i>Applause</i>.)</p><p>A number of regions, such as Moscow Region
and Kaliningrad Region, and St Petersburg, have drastically improved their business
environment. I am pleased to note that our Far Eastern regions –Khabarovsk
Territory and Amur Region – have for the first time joined the leaders of change. I am asking the heads of all Russian regions to never stop building on such efforts, and to open up new opportunities for businesses so that they can work
successfully and freely.</p><p>Effectively protecting rights,
businesses and property is critical for entrepreneurs and all citizens, for that matter. In this regard, I would like to say that a package of proposals to improve the judicial system has already been agreed upon. It was discussed and worked through in conjunction with experts and senior officials of the Supreme
Court of the Russian Federation.</p><p>The has to do with increasing the independence of judges and improving the training of judicial personnel,
streamlining the judicial process, and reducing the unreasonable burden on judges.
The purpose of these measures is to create additional guarantees of fair and objective
judicial proceedings.</p><p>Next, we
have already created an array of tools to support investment projects. We will
develop them, making them more flexible and targeted. What exactly do we
suggest doing in this context?</p><p>First, a solid systemic foundation needs to be created for the project financing
mechanism and investment risks minimised at all stages – from developing
projects to implementing them, including by providing partial state guarantees,
and drawing resources from different types of investors: banks, investment
companies and pension funds.</p><p>I am
asking the Government and the Bank of Russia to accelerate the enactment of amendments to laws that make the syndicated loan mechanism more flexible.
Yesterday, last night, we discussed this with our colleagues, and this should
be done, of course, as soon as possible. All of this will ensure a substantial
increase in private financial resources for launching new projects in the real
economic sector.</p><p>Second, to ensure accelerated economic growth rates, we need to significantly increase
investment in transport, energy, communications and other infrastructure.
Private capital should become a source of additional investment. However, high
risks remain an impediment here, as well.</p><p>Therefore,
it is important to establish understandable, stable rules protecting investors’
rights. Return on their capital investment should be ensured through regular
payments that will come from the principal beneficiaries of infrastructure
facilities. These are budgets at various levels, natural monopolies and other
infrastructure users.</p><p>The mechanism of state guarantees can also be used to ensure payments. In other
words, this is about introducing a kind of an infrastructure mortgage mechanism
where an infrastructure project is in effect bought on a loan received from
private investors while the user of that facility gradually repays the loan.</p><p>For this
model to be launched, I am asking the Government to develop a comprehensive
approach toward infrastructure development with the participation of private
capital. It should cover all stages: preparation, financing and implementation
of these projects. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, we are interested in investment going to high-tech sectors. A few
days ago, the MS-21, an advanced Russian medium-range passenger plane, made its
maiden flight. I have already spoken to the company management by telephone and I would like to thank and congratulate all those involved in implementing this
project.</p><p>In both
aviation and other sectors that are critically important for Russia’s
development, we need our own developments and competencies. They should be
restored or created from the ground up. These include advanced production
technologies and materials, power and power storage systems, transport and logistics management, information security systems, Arctic and shelf
development technology, modern diagnostic and therapy methods, and agricultural
and food processing technologies.</p><p>Obviously,
we can untie these technological knots only by involving major private
investors who are interested both in new technological solutions and in diversifying
their own businesses. To enable them to become actively involved in this work,
attractive and understandable conditions should certainly be provided for them.
This can be done through special so-called investment contracts. I propose
considering ways of improving this mechanism. </p><p>Generally,
it works, but it needs upgrading. It should be made an effective tool. For example, the term of special investment contracts could be extended from the current 10 years to 20 years with provisions to be made for flexible
participation not only by federal government bodies, regions and investors, but
also by development institutions, banks, natural monopolies and other agencies.</p><p>This
concerns above all critically important areas and sectors, as well as situations where an investor is unlikely to come without state support, without
a clear-cut and understandable system of support, because benefits and profits
cannot be immediately made on such projects: This is not quick money. </p><p>It is also
important to extend demand guarantees to products created within the framework
of special investment projects on the part of both the state and companies with
state participation. </p><p>Another
important thing. It is essential to ensure that tax and other conditions
related to state regulation remain unchanged throughout the term of a contract’s implementation. As for taxes, I propose extending the current
exemption on profit tax until after 2025. </p><p>I would
like to stress that the pinpoint solutions related to developing critical
technology that I have just mentioned must not lead to the destruction of the competitive environment in the economy as a whole. I am asking the Government
to analyse all these issues and submit specific proposals. We will discuss the areas of our joint efforts to address technological development goals at one of the next meetings with business representatives. </p><p>Next.
These days, breakthrough innovative technology is often developed by small
companies, so-called start-ups. As a rule, this technology is created by teams
of young researchers. I am certain that they can become effective partners for major Russian businesses, and we will expand this partnership, creating
essential infrastructure. We intend to begin creating innovative research and technology centres at our leading schools of higher learning. Education,
research and high-tech and venture companies will be concentrated here in one
place. All of them will be closely integrated with each other. </p><p>I am
calling for the management of our major companies – Rostec, the Federal Space
Agency, the United Aircraft Corporation, the United Shipbuilding Corporation,
Rosatom and other domestic high-tech companies – to actively use the opportunities opening up.</p><p>It is
important to create subdivisions that will work closely with start-ups and small innovative companies, as well as venture funds, to finance such projects.
I am asking you to make sure that this does not remain empty rhetoric. I am
asking you to do this in practice and as soon as possible. </p><p>For its
part, big business should have a clear-cut legal mechanism for acquiring or entering the capital of small innovation companies. I am asking the Government
and the State Duma to prepare and adopt appropriate amendments to the law.</p><p>Dear
friends, we are going through a difficult and contradictory but very exciting
period that is rich in new ideas, discoveries, projects and rapid change. It takes
persistence and strong will to meet the challenges of the times, because this
is about building our future, while it has always been shaped by daring, smart,
focused and capable people – those who are prepared to translate their
intellectual abilities and entrepreneurship into bold innovative plans and efforts that help the country. </p><p>It is this
kind of people, including very young people, who achieve success in science,
develop modern business projects and implement civic and social initiatives.
Therefore, we will augment our human capital and I am sure that we will be able
to ensure sustainable long-term growth – to qualitatively improve the Russian
economy, and to transform Russia and change our citizens’ lives for the better.
</p><p>Great
creative work lies ahead and we invite everyone to participate. I am certain
that this partnership will be interesting and mutually beneficial. </p><p>We welcome
you to work with Russia!</p><p>Thank you
for your attention. Thank you very much. </p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>Thank you,
President Putin. We are going to continue with the speeches in just a minute.
But they encouraged me to ask questions in-between if I have any, and I have
one that I want to ask Mr President.</p><p>You
mentioned that Russia is entering a new phase of growth right now. But there
remains in Russia a significant income inequality problem. They say that the top one percent here in Russia holds over 70 percent of the wealth. And walking
around talking to some of the Russian people, they say they are spending too
much money on food, they are spending much money out of their budget on shoes.
What’s being done to address that?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: To resolve this issue, we need to implement the programme I just
mentioned. We need to develop new technologies. This is not about spending
money left and right or handing it out, it is about making our economy generate
more revenue, so that our people earn higher incomes, accordingly. This can be
done only by developing innovative technologies, including digital technologies.</p><p>The problem you mentioned is real. It is characteristic not only of Russia,
but of many other economies as well. We are aware of it; we acknowledge that it
exists, and that it is highly sensitive. This is my first point.</p><p>Secondly, we cannot afford to wait too long. Therefore, the state must find
ways to redistribute resources using the tools at its disposal in order to support those who find themselves in a difficult situation.</p><p>We have many such tools, such as support for low-income families to pay
their utility bills. This may not seem very special at first glance, but it is
important for the people. They also include the maternity capital that we pay
to families with two or more children. I know you have three children. If you
were a Russian citizen, you would receive it as well. However, this is not
enough.</p><p>We must build up targeted support. That is, on the one hand, we should help
people who honestly – and I want to emphasise this – honestly earned their
capital, and help them invest in expanding our economy, rather than
consumption. On the other hand, we should develop targeted support measures for those who need help from the state.</p><p><b>&lt;</b>…<b>&gt; </b></p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>Now we are going to have some questions amongst all the panel, and there’s a lot to cover, so stay with me. So let us start with what has been in the news everywhere, what’s on the minds of a lot of people here today, which
is that yesterday, as you gentlemen know, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris climate deal, saying that it will
hurt the United States economy and cost jobs. European leaders were quick to react, accusing President Trump of shirking America’s role as a global leader.
President Putin, how do you see it?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I do not belong to the category of European leaders, at any rate they do
not think I do (<i>laughter</i>, <i>applause</i>), but of course we, I mean Russia, have
our own viewpoint. Have you read the Paris Agreement? No, you have not, as I can see.</p><p>In general, the Paris Agreement is a good, logical document aimed at resolving one of today’s global problems – preventing climate change. The question is whether we are in a position to avert climate change. What does it
do? The goal is to prevent a two-degree rise in temperature.</p><p>So far, we do not get the sense here that the temperature is going up
rapidly. Actually, we should be grateful to President Trump. I heard it was
actually snowing in Moscow today, while here it is raining and quite chilly.
Now we can blame everything on him and US imperialism, and say it is all their
fault. But we will not. </p><p>As for the Paris Agreement, it is a framework document that relegates all
decisions to national governments. It does not contain any mandatory
requirements. All countries are to make decisions independently. The United
States undertook to reduce emissions by 26–28 percent by 2025, as I recall,
while Russia committed itself to reduce them by 70 percent of the 1990s level
but by 2030. </p><p>If memory serves, the United States ratified the agreement whereas we
have not done so yet. However, we have not done this because we want to wait
for the rules for distributing resources and other strictly technical but
important matters to be worked out. The United States assumed an obligation to contribute $100 billion to the so-called Green Climate Fund that is to be used
to help developing nations implement environmental programmes. But how these
funds are supposed to be transferred and who will dispose of them – these
issues have not been resolved yet.</p><p>Here is the premise I am working from. To cut emissions by 26–28 percent by 2025 – that is
not too far away – obviously, it is essential to modernise production on a really big scale. It is important to force businesses to invest hundreds of millions and maybe billions – that is right, billions of dollars in the economy. </p><p>The other
side of the coin is that it is necessary to think about what to do with the employees who will be made redundant in the production system today. They need
to be employed, and this requires planning ahead and appropriate resources,
unless we want them to fall by the wayside and join the army of people living
below the poverty line. </p><p>I was
asked about people with low incomes in Russia. By the way, since 2000, we have
almost halved the number of people living below the poverty line, from 40
percent. There are certain fluctuations related to the current crisis but
nevertheless, we have managed to do this. So the United States should also
think about what to do about people who will end up without a job. These are
additional resources.</p><p>Therefore,
I will not pass judgment on President Trump right now, because President Obama
made certain decisions and maybe the incumbent president believes they were not
well thought out. Maybe he thinks that there are not enough resources to go
round. All of this calls for careful analysis. However, in my view, it was
unnecessary to pull out of the Paris Agreement because it is a framework agreement
in nature. Now, what could have been done?</p><p>The US
commitments within the framework of the Paris Agreement could have been
changed. However, what is done cannot be undone. What has been said cannot be
unsaid, and now it is time to think about how to proceed, what to do next. As for the problem, of course, it should not be ignored. However, as far as I know
(granted, I am not acquainted with the text of President Trump’s statement), he
said he would like either to review the agreement or sign a new agreement. </p><p>After all,
he is not refusing to work on this issue. And it seems to me that now it is
important not to make a fuss but to create conditions for joint work because if
such countries, such large emitters as the United States do not cooperate, then
it will be impossible to coordinate and sign any agreement in this area.
Therefore, it is essential to make do with what there is and seek to put this
work on a constructive track. </p><p>Incidentally,
this agreement has not even entered into force yet. It should come into force
in 2021, so we still have time. If we work constructively, we will still be
able to agree on something. Don’t worry, be happy! [last four words said in English]</p><p>&lt;…&gt;</p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>President Putin, does all this squabbling over NATO help Russia? </p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: Disputes over NATO? Do they help Russia?</p><p>Well, in the sense that NATO may fall apart, yes, this may help. However,
for the time being, there are no signs of it falling apart. You know, I wondered on many occasions and even asked this question publicly. NATO was
created as a Cold War instrument to oppose the Soviet Union and what was known
as the Warsaw Pact. Now there is neither the Warsaw Pact, nor the Soviet Union,
but NATO is still there.</p><p>Hence, the question: why? There is only one answer – no matter what they
say, it is an instrument of US foreign policy. If someone likes it that way, so
be it. What is important is if the processes that NATO has always mentioned,
specifically there was talk of transforming this bloc into a political organisation
which would create essential elements of stability across the world, if this
happens, then that is probably not a bad thing. However, this has not
materialised so far. What we have seen so far is their military infrastructure
expanding and approaching our borders. This cannot but cause concern for us,
and we have mentioned it many times publicly.</p><p>Speaking of the recent summit, the United States is demanding that its
allies increase their military spending, while maintaining at the same time
that NATO has no plans to attack anyone. If you are not going to attack anyone,
why increase military spending? Of course, this raises additional questions on our part.</p><p>Therefore, you know, we tried to establish a constructive dialogue with
this organisation, and even created the Russia-NATO Council in Rome. However,
all this ceased to exist, and not through our fault. The absence of such
instruments of cooperation is a bad thing, because it does not allow us to constructively work on the issues on the current agenda.</p><p>They say that NATO should step up its fight against terrorism. This is
good, and we support this. But, at the same time, what do we see? Look, we have
just held a major international conference on security issues at the level of security councils of our partner countries. Representatives from 95 countries
attended. Many representatives from the American continent and Europe whispered
to us that Brussels and Washington tried to talk them out of going to Russia.</p><p>What is that about? People who take such a position, what part of their
body do they think with? The professionals are willing to cooperate, they
realise the importance of such interaction and information sharing. The politicians ride in armoured vehicles, they are safe, and apparently do not
sense any threat to their citizens.</p><p>If it stays that way, we will be hit in Germany, Brussels, the United
States, and Russia. I said many times that it is necessary to unite efforts in order to fight major threats, one of which is terrorism. If NATO works constructively
in this area, we will cooperate, of course.</p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>President Putin, you and Prime Minister Modi yesterday entered into
several agreements promising more cooperation between your two countries on things like counterterrorism and agreeing to have Russia set up the final two
units of a nuclear power plant in India. What is the significance of this
cooperation? And you mentioned your relationship of trust between each other.
How does China fit into that relationship?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>You know, disagreements always have been and still are part of the fabric
of our world. Our task – mine, and President Xí Jinping’s and Prime Minister Modi’s – is to find streets, two-way
streets, despite all these disagreements, rather than get stuck in dead ends. </p><p>Once the three of us – the President of Russia,
and the leaders of China and India – got together here some time in 2005
despite all the difficulties, including regional disagreements. We agreed to get together and resolve common problems. This work was launched despite all
the difficulties and disagreements.</p><p>It was launched and went so well that Brazil and the South African Republic wanted to join us. This led to the emergence of BRICS, which is a major factor in international affairs today. I believe this
is a very positive process, and that is how it is viewed by the People’s
Republic of China, by the Chinese leaders. </p><p>I spoke about this fairly recently, maybe at yesterday’s meeting with the heads of news agencies – we conducted border talks
with China for forty years but owing to the atmosphere that was created in our
bilateral relations we managed to find a compromise. Of course, one could say
that we gave in on something or China gave in on something, but we got it done
and it created more opportunities for advancing relations.</p><p>We have never had any problems with India. I hope
we never will have any. On the contrary, we have only positives, and there are
a great many. I am referring to our historical cooperation. Yesterday we signed
a number of agreements that are aimed at developing the already traditional
areas of cooperation as well as new ones.</p><p>We are trying to find new forms of interaction
and, naturally, we want to focus on innovative sectors of the modern economy
first and foremost. This certainly applies to the nuclear industry, as you
mentioned. A number of units are already operating in India and we have
ambitious plans for future cooperation. There are very interesting and promising areas for us to work in. </p><p>We will provide comprehensive support to those
who are involved in this because such cooperation will benefit the people of both India and Russia and, actually, the entire region. This will also
facilitate the implementation of the Chinese leadership’s projects related to the Silk Road. We spoke about coordinating efforts of the Eurasian Economic
Union and China’s Silk Road plans. There are always issues that require
additional study. But we want to follow this path and we will follow it, and provided there is goodwill, we most certainly will achieve success. </p><p><b>&lt;</b>…<b>&gt; </b></p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>On the subject of relationships, one of the elements between Russia and the United States today, and indeed Russia and Europe today, is the allegation
that Russia interfered in elections. Mr Putin, this week you told a French
newspaper that Russia is being accused of interfering with the US election by people who lost that election, who don’t want to admit defeat. But all 17 of the United States’ intelligence agencies have concluded the Russians did
interfere with our election, and these are non-partisan career professionals.Republicans and Democrats alike on Capitol Hill, including President
Trump’s supporters (and some are your defenders) who have seen the classified
intelligence report have all accepted this conclusion. And even private non-partisan
security firms say the same – that Russia interfered with the US election. Are
they all wrong?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> Have you read these reports? </p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>I have read the non-classified version.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> A non-classified version means no version. “‘Who made the suit?’ ‘Are
the pockets good?’ ‘They are.’ ‘Are the buttons sewn on well?’ ‘They are.’ ‘Do
you have any complaints about the buttons.’ ‘No, they are sewn tight, but the suit is so ill-fitting I can’t wear it.’” Can such a thing happen? It happened
to Arkady Raikin, one of our stand-up comedians. </p><p>Now you
also say, “a non-classified version.” I have read these reports. There is
nothing specific in these reports. There is only supposition and inference in those reports. That is it. You know, if there is anything specific, then there
will be something to discuss. As they used to say in the organisation where I worked at one time: “addresses, safe houses, names.” So, where is all that?</p><p>As for independent sources, there is nothing independent in this world. Even the recent appointments in your intelligence services show that there are some
predilections all the same. Therefore, it seems to me that this useless and harmful idle talk should come to an end. </p><p>To reiterate, this is bringing domestic political squabbles in the US out into the world arena. It is an attempt to address a domestic political issues with
foreign policy tools.</p><p>This is
detrimental, damaging to international relations, the global economy, security
issues and the fight against terrorism. It is simply harmful. I have just given
you the example of Washington warning against attending a counterterrorism
event in Russia. This is absolute nonsense. </p><p>Somebody
is behind this. The people who engage in this nonsense also initiate such
reports. I think this needs to come to an end, and the sooner, the better. It
is necessary to begin normal cooperation. </p><p>What else
can I say? There are not so many countries in the world that enjoy the privilege of sovereignty. I do not want to hurt anyone but what Ms Merkel has
said was dictated, among other things, by long-standing resentment – I assure
you, despite whatever she might have said later – over the fact that
sovereignty is in fact limited.</p><p>By the way, it is limited officially within the framework of military-political
alliances, where it is stipulated what may and may not be done, but in reality,
it is even worse: Nothing is permitted except for what is permitted. And who gives
permission? The chiefs. And where are the chiefs? They are far away.</p><p>To reiterate, there are not so many countries that have sovereignty. Russia
treasures its sovereignty, but not as a toy. We need sovereignty to protect our
interests and to ensure our own development. India has sovereignty and we know
it. Now I would like to say something to the Prime Minister. I have never said
this to him, even though yesterday we talked face to face for several hours and before that also for several hours, but now I would like to say it to him
publicly. </p><p>We know
the position of the Indian Prime Minister, of the Indian leadership, the Indian
people and the Indian state regarding all the attempts over the past several
years to compel India to adopt a position on Russia that is beneficial for someone but not for the Indian people. Relying on its sovereignty, on the character of its leader and on its national interests, India does not let these
advisers push it around. However, there are not so many countries like India in the world. That is true. We should simply bear this in mind. India is one such
country and so is China. I will not enumerate them all: There are other
countries, too, but not many.</p><p>If these
attempts continue to order people around in or outside a country using
unreliable information, it will damage international relations. But to reiterate – and at this point I would like to conclude my answer – this must
eventually come to an end.</p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>So one of the reasons the question is relevant is because the United
States views this as a matter of its national sovereignty, as does the UK, as does Germany, as does France, and so it keeps coming up over and over. And what
they say in response to the question of “Where is the proof?” is that this type
of disinformation campaign is intentionally difficult to find hardcore proof
of. It is other factors. And what the experts say is that this couldn’t have
been faked – that it’s not one factor, it is a hundred factors that point to Russia. They say it is the forensics, it’s the digital fingerprints, it’s the IP addresses, the malware, the encryption keys, the specific pieces of code –
that all of them, all of them, point to Russia and none of them points to anyone
other than Russia.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> What fingerprints? Hoof prints, horn prints? Whose fingerprints are
these?</p><p>IP
addresses can be simply made up. Do you know how many such specialists there
are? They will make it look like it was sent from your home address by your
children – your three-year old kid, they will organise everything to look like
it was your three-year old daughter who carried out the attack. There are such
IT specialists in the world today and they can arrange anything and then blame
it on whoever.</p><p>This is no
proof. It is an attempt to lay the blame at someone else’s door. This is not
our problem. The problem is in US politics. That is the problem. Trump’s team
proved more capable during the election campaign. At times, I actually thought
the man was overdoing it, really. That is true. However, it turned out that he
was right, that he found a key to those social groups and voters’ groups that
he had bet on, and they came out and voted for him. </p><p>The other
team lost. They are reluctant to acknowledge the mistake. They do not want to admit that they did not get it, that they miscalculated. It is easier to say, “We
are not to blame, the Russians are to blame, they interfered in our election,
but we are good.” It reminds me of anti-Semitism: the Jews are to blame for everything.
The halfwit cannot do anything but the Jews are the ones who are to blame. </p><p>However,
we know what such sentiments can lead to. They lead to nothing good. The thing
to do is simply to work and think of how to get things right.</p><p>You have
just mentioned disinformation. What disinformation? One of the hackers’ planted
stories was that Mrs Clinton’s election campaign managers had acted unfairly
with regard to other Democratic Party candidates. However, when that
information appeared in the public domain, the campaign manager actually
acknowledged that it was true and resigned. Is that disinformation? It is
truthful information. </p><p>Does it
really matter who revealed it? They should have apologised to the public and they should have said before resigning, “We will not repeat these mistakes.” But
what did they do? They said, “We are not to blame. It is the Russians.” What
have the Russians got to do with it? Did the Russians engage in pushing through
one Democratic Party candidate to the detriment of another candidate? Whatever
the case might be, we did not do it. They were the ones who did it. Enough. (<i>Applause</i>.) </p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>Even President Trump has said now that he believes Russia did it. So it is
not just people who don’t want President Trump in office. And the difference
between the hacking and the disinformation…</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> She just won’t let it go. (<i>Laughter</i>.)</p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>The difference between the hacking and the disinformation – this is not
my allegation, this is the conclusion of the 17 US intelligence agencies and the others that I mentioned. What they say is Russia not only that hacked into
the Democratic National Committee and hacked into Hillary Clinton’s campaign
emails, but that they also perpetuated a campaign of disinformation that
involved putting out fake news stories through Russian-controlled entities like
RT and Sputnik, and that those then were pushed by aggregators and what are
called “bots” on Twitter and elsewhere, and specifically targeted at voters who
were potentially pro-Trump, voters in the Rust Belt of America, in Wisconsin,
in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, who were potentially gettable for Trump. And that
is the conclusion that they have reached. </p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> We should all learn from American journalists. Megyn is doing
first-class professional aerobatics. I have just given her an example showing
that there was no disinformation, whoever planted the story regarding the manipulations within the Democratic Party during the elections.</p><p>There is
no getting away from the fact that the campaign manager, managing director (or whatever the position is called there) resigned. I just said it and she goes:
“Disinformation.” What disinformation? Where is the disinformation? I simply do
not know. Do you understand? I do not know.</p><p>She says, specifically
President Trump. Again, give me the text showing what he actually said. Did he
say he won because of Russian interference? I do not think I ever saw anything
like that. </p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>He did. He finally came around to saying “I think Russia did it”, and he said,
“I don’t think they’ll do it again.” </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: She thinks! Listen, these
are very serious global political issues, and you think. It is not just any
interview or some piece for a newspaper. </p><p>As for interference, you should have seen what you colleagues are doing here. They
have simply barged into our internal politics with their shoes on. They are
walking all over us, chewing gum. They are just having fun.</p><p>This is
systematic, years-long, gross, absolutely unceremonious interference in our
domestic policy, including the level of diplomatic missions. Let us end this.
You will feel better, and we will feel better.</p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>Prime Minister Modi, President Putin said the other day that Russia does
not engage in state-sponsored interference with other countries’ elections. Do
you believe that?</p><p><b>Vladimir</b><b>Putin</b><b>: </b>Ask Mr Dodon. He
knows.
(<i>Laughter</i>.<i> Applause</i>.)</p><p><b>Narendra Modi: </b>You are talking about America, Germany,
Russia, Trump, Hillary Clinton, Chancellor Merkel and Putin. You are talking
about people who, it seems, do not need a judge or lawyer like myself.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: It is not all that simple
with the Hindus. It is an ancient philosophy. It is only we, ordinary people,
who say exactly what we think.</p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>President Putin, there are reports today in the American press that the Trump administration took active steps to ease sanctions on Russia almost
immediately after Trump took office. Was this possibility ever discussed
between the Trump team and your representatives prior to President Trump being
inaugurated? </p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>You know, I saw what was happening. Frankly, I was also amazed. What nonsense they are talking. I do not know where these
people who are spreading this information have come from. This is simply
disastrous!</p><p>Our ambassador met with someone. What should an ambassador do? That is
his job. That is what he gets paid for. He should have meetings, discussing
current affairs, reaching agreements. What is he supposed to do there? Go to the kind of places that he will be fired for visiting? No. This is his job but
he is being accused of meeting with someone. Are you nuts out there or what?
This is diplomatic service. This is just amazing. </p><p>I saw that President Trump then fired his aide because he was accused of talking to somebody somewhere. You see, I am telling you, but of course those
who have a different position will not believe me, but I simply knew nothing
about that. Who met with whom there? What did they talk about?</p><p>They
talked about nothing. There were simply general words, simply general words
about the need to think about how to develop our relations. Should we not think
about developing our relations, or what? Should we simply act on the spur of the moment? Nothing specific, simply zero, zilch, nothing at all. Just amazing.
</p><p>This is some
sort of hysteria and you cannot stop it. Do you need to take something for that?
Does anyone have a pill? Give her a pill or something. (<i>Laughter</i>.) Honestly, frankly, this is amazing. </p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>Let us talk about those sanctions, which have now been in place, by the Europeans and the United States, since 2014 against Russia. Do you believe they
have hurt more than helped?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I believe that, firstly, the sanctions have been imposed in violation
of all international norms and rules. The United States, for one, has always
been upholding the ideas of a free market, open economy, always teaching
everyone (now apparently it is giving up on teaching others because it needs
some teaching itself) and saying that politics should not influence global
economic processes and that politics will only interfere with the economy, but
then did precisely what they cautioned everyone against doing.</p><p>First of all, I would like to say that the events that happened and served as a cause
and pretext for imposing those restrictions were not brought about by our
policy. As a matter of fact, they were caused by US policy. Look, they spoke
about the “greater” Middle East. Although nobody could formulate what this concept
of the “greater” Middle East means.</p><p>Then they
devastated Iraq and Libya and almost ruined Syria and destabilised and brought
Egypt and Tunisia to the point of disaster. I am not even talking about the processes that were already under way in other countries, such as Somalia, and after that, they got to work in the so-called post-Soviet space.</p><p>After all,
they said openly that they had spent almost $5 billion on supporting the opposition in Ukraine and they supported the coup. What is this? It is support
of a military takeover. When we disagreed with that, they imposed sanctions on us. However, we can never agree to this and never will. </p><p>When we
supported Russian people and people who consider themselves to be close to the Russian world, Russian-speakers in Crimea, who were simply intimidated by the anti-Russian
propaganda and the surge in racist sentiments and radical views, as well as physical actions – people were being killed in Kiev – when we supported them
and in keeping with international law, supported a referendum, sanctions were immediately
imposed. And what did you expect? </p><p>Look at what is going on now in Yemen. Its president was also overthrown, and the entire Western world led by the US supports the actions of countries that are
in effect conducting hostilities there. Should we, too, have conducted
hostilities all over Ukraine or what?</p><p>Let us
agree on a uniform interpretation of the norms and fundamental principles of international law and adhere to these rules. Because until that happens and as long as the principle that might is right is asserted, we will continue to have
problems like the ones we are currently seeing in North Korea. </p><p>Smaller countries can see no other way
to protect their independence, security and sovereignty but by acquiring
nuclear weapons. This is what abuse of power leads to. This gave rise, unfortunately,
to the restrictions and limitations in the economy. Who suffered more from them:
we or those who imposed them? It is absolutely clear that they have done considerable
damage to those who imposed them.</p><p>I see here one of the former leaders
of the German organisation of the so-called eastern economy which maintains
relations with Russia. They calculated that Germany lost several hundred
thousand jobs. Did it hurt us? Yes, of course, the restrictions hurt us. This
is mainly due to the financing restrictions and the work of our financial
organisations, the transfer of technologies. But there is a positive side to it
because we were able to ramp up the development of whole sectors of the Russian
economy.</p><p>Our agriculture grows by more than
three percent each year, around three percent, which we have never had before,
this is a phenomenon, to be honest. I had some concerns about how we were going
to solve the problem. It is indeed being solved. Incidentally, we would not
have been able to do that ten years ago, whereas now we can, and we are doing
it well. It pushes the development of a number of hi-tech sectors of the economy. We had to use our heads rather than just sit back and enjoy the oil
and gas revenues. We had to stoke the development of some technologies,
fundamental and applied science, and we see the positive results.</p><p>And now we have growing exports in sectors other than raw materials, oil and gas. I do not remember exactly, I spoke
about this with my colleagues yesterday, I believe. Those exports have grown by 10 percent this year, and they also grew last year. What does this indicate? It
indicates structural changes in the economy itself. This is only the very
beginning of the road, we still have a lot to do, there is much that has not
been done yet, but it is basically the beginning of the road. </p><p>Thus, on the whole there is nothing
good about it but it is not going to kill us either. As the Chancellor of Austria said here quoting Mark Twain, “The reports of my death are greatly
exaggerated.” about the same is true of the sanctions. But we would rather
there were none, and we need to put an end to that.</p><p>&lt;…&gt;</p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>Thank you for your kind words first of all. Flattery will get you everywhere. I appreciate that.</p><p>Let us shift gears if we may
to Syria for a minute. President Putin I know that you said that you do not
believe…</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> Christian spoke about the Minsk Agreements here. It is an important issue
because it is the Ukraine crisis that lies at the root of today’s problems and sanctions. We keep on hearing “Everything will be all right if Russia complies
with the Minsk Agreements.”</p><p>Russia cannot unilaterally comply with the Minsk Agreements. We are ready
to support this process but we cannot do what Kiev authorities are obliged to do. They do everything to prevent any improvement, absolutely everything. You
actually do not take any notice of some things, or pretend not to.</p><p>I did not mean you personally, I meant some Western media and my western
colleagues. Everybody says there is shooting there but it is not clear who is
doing the shooting. There was fire but it is unclear who was behind it. As a result, nothing is done; heavy armaments are not withdrawn from the contact
line.</p><p>It was agreed to launch economic rehabilitation of those unrecognised
republics, those territories. And what is happening in reality? Radicals
decided to completely block any movement of people and goods. President
Poroshenko tried to open it up again, staged a fight and shooting at the sky. But
he still did not achieve anything.</p><p>And even though he publicly claimed that those behind it are virtually criminals
who should be brought to order, after one or two days, when he realised that he
was unable to do anything about it, he issued his own executive order about his
joining in and signed off on the blockade officially. But the Minsk Agreements
clearly state, I think, in Item 8, to conduct rehabilitation, to take off the blockade. But no, he joined the blockade by an official resolution. What are
you demanding from us? What do you want us to do in this case?</p><p>Another example. They shut down all Russian media outlets, and they do not let
Russian performers and journalists into the country. Now they have closed
access to social networks. You are a journalist, where is free information exchange?
Who is going to guarantee it, particularly in Ukraine? Why is everybody keeping
silent about it? Why are all the demands being directed at Moscow? We will never
solve any problem this way.</p><p>If you started that ball rolling, and it was indeed largely you who started
the ball rolling, then do something to stop this. Just something. It is not
enough to point your finger at Russia all the time. I am saying this not so
much to you; this will be read and heard by those who take real decisions. They
know my stand but I would like them to hear it once again.</p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>Shifting gears to Syria, our president has said that you are backing an evil guy there. He said that Assad is an evil guy. Do you believe that?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> What? That Assad is an evil person? Ask other leaders who have met him.
After all, since he was elected, he has been to Europe more often than to Russia. We are not defending so much President Assad as Syrian statehood. We do
not want Syria to be confronted with a situation similar to that in Libya or Somalia or Afghanistan, where NATO has been present for many years but the situation is not changing for the better. </p><p>We want to preserve [Syrian] statehood and once this fundamental matter is resolved, to move
further towards settling the Syrian crisis by political means. Yes, perhaps
everyone is to blame for something there. But let us not forget that if it were
not for active intervention from the outside we would not have had the situation and the civil war that we are seeing now.</p><p>What does
President Assad stand accused of today? We know about the charges of using
chemical weapons. There is absolutely no proof. As soon as that happened we
proposed conducting an inspection right there on the airfield from where
President Assad’s aircraft had allegedly taken off with chemical weapons on board. I would like to reiterate because not everyone has heard this: if
chemical weapons had been used, if some shells with toxic agents had been
loaded, modern analysers, modern control systems would definitely have detected
that there were chemical weapons there on board this aircraft, on that exact spot.</p><p>They
declined. Nobody wants to. There is a lot of talk but no practical action. We
proposed conducting an inspection in the area of the attack, “Let us see what
there is.” No way again. “Why not?” “It is too dangerous there.” “What is so
dangerous there if the strike was allegedly carried out against the good part
of the armed opposition? These are normal people out there, why would they be dangerous?”
“No, it is not possible there either.” However, it is known for certain that in Iraq (an Iraqi representative is present here, and we also welcome him), in Iraqi Kurdistan, militants used chemical weapons and that fact was established
by the entire international community. Therefore, they have them. And judging
by the statements made by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Syria
has destroyed these weapons.</p><p>You see,
if reasons and excuses are invoked, without any intention of looking into the essence of the problem, then one can talk about anything. Let us get down to the heart of the matter. Has Assad made mistakes? He probably has, and quite a few, too. Now, are the people who are up against him angels? Who is killing
people, executing children and beheading people there? Are we supposed to support them?</p><p>As you
know, we argued with our US colleagues until we were blue in the face about
whether certain territories could be attacked. “No, that is off limits.” “Why?”
“The healthy part of the opposition is based there.” We say: “But ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra are still there.” “Yes, but everything is intermingled there,
so it is hard to understand who is where.” “Well, separate them then. What are
decent, honest people doing with terrorists? Do you have control over them? Let
them go and let us fight terrorists.” “No, do not touch them.” Why not? Should
we wait until they come to you or to us? We will not. If you want to agree on something, let’s agree.</p><p>The Prime
Minister is nodding because India is constantly confronted with the terrorist
threat. It is not an imaginary problem. According to our preliminary estimate,
there are 4,000 people from Russia alone in Syria, plus 4,500–5,000 from the CIS countries, mainly from Central Asia. It is a real threat to us. They are
trying to return. Some are in fact returning. This is precisely why we began
our operation in Syria, because we realised where things were headed. So, there
should be no name-calling. Let us simply work together on the matter at hand.
We are prepared for this. What is needed is a constructive position on your
part.</p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>So, we know that Assad has used chemical weapons before, and Russia
entered into an agreement in 2013 to stop that. I mean, Russia acknowledged
that in 2013 to try to stop that by Assad. The only question is whether he
launched the chemical weapons attack that happened a couple of months ago. And I just want to ask you, to press you a little further on this, because we all
saw the video of the suffering, dying children, and that was the reason that
President Trump dropped the bomb. Do you deny – because Assad denies that those
tapes are real, he is purporting to tell us not to believe our lying eyes – do
you believe those tapes are fake?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>Firstly, when President Obama and I agreed to work together on destroying chemical weapons in Syria, we acted on the premise that those
weapons were out there. However, we have never acknowledged that Assad used
them. I would ask you to be more accurate. </p><p>Secondly, regarding
the people killed or injured as a result of the use of weapons, including
chemical weapons, this is false information. At the moment, we are absolutely
certain that it was simply a provocation. Assad did not use those weapons and all of that was done by people who wanted to blame it on him. </p><p>Furthermore,
our intelligence services received additional information suggesting that there
were plans to re-enact a similar scenario in other parts of Syria, including
near Damascus. We made that information public. Thank God, the plotters had
enough common sense not to follow through. </p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>If I could just follow up on that, though, because the bodies of the victims were autopsied at Turkey’s and our forensic medicine institution. The autopsies were witnessed by officials from the World Health Organisation and from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, and they
concluded that the victims were attacked with zarin gas. Are we really to believe that the whole thing
was staged? That everybody was in on it – the World Health Organisation, the forensic
medicine institution, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> The answer is very simple and you know it: it could have been used –
however, not by Assad, but by someone else in order to put the blame on Assad.
So any further investigation without understanding who did it is senseless. It
only plays into the hands of the provocateurs who organised this attack. That
is all. What is there you cannot understand? It seems to me that everything is
absolutely clear. </p><p>However, I would like to ask you a question: why didn’t they immediately go
to the spot from where the chemical weapon attack had allegedly been launched?
Why did nobody go to inspect the airfield? Why did nobody inspect the aircraft
that had allegedly been used to carry out the strike, as we proposed? Why did
nobody go to the place of the attack? The answer is simple: because they were
afraid that this entire falsification would be uncovered – that is all.</p><p>As for what you are telling me, it does not convince me in the least but only goes to show that it would be far better not to indulge in speculation or a tug of war
but combine efforts against real threats. We know very well what it is like.
America is far away and there was a minor explosion, as a result of which,
unfortunately, people were hurt at a well-known athletic event. And do you have
any idea of how we have suffered here? We know full well, who we have to deal
with. </p><p>Under no
circumstances can anyone from this environment, which is hostile to modern
civilisation, be used to address current political issues. Meanwhile, sometimes
we see such attempts: “Let’s use these and those to fight Assad.” Why these and those? Because there is nobody else who can fight. Once you use them today, you
will never know what will happen to you tomorrow. Then they will start fighting
you. </p><p>At one
time, Al-Qaeda was created to fight against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. And then Al-Qaeda carried out the 9/11 attacks in the United States. This is what this
can lead to. It is important to think about the possible long-term
consequences.</p><p><b>&lt;</b>…<b>&gt;</b></p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>Last question. We have talked a lot today about things that divide us,
that divide our countries, each of our countries. And it would be nice if we
could end it on what unites us, because there are many things, separate and apart from the disagreements our countries have. President Putin, I will give
you the last word.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>We are sitting here, discussing numerous
problems. There is a representative of India with us today, one of the largest
countries in the world. Russia, too, has some importance. There is an EU
representative. There is a representative of a small country in the post-Soviet
space. In other words, all regions are represented.</p><p>Mr Dodon has said that the world ceased to be unipolar. No, an American journalist
is sitting here, ordering everyone around and giving the last word. (<i>Laughter</i>.) However, generally speaking,
I believe this kind of unipolar world, with this quality of discussion, suits
everyone. In any event, let us thank our moderator. </p><p>As for what unites us, there is a lot that unites us. The Prime Minister has just
talked about fighting terrorism. Should not shared threats unite us? Should not
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons,
unite us? We need to understand what is going on and where this can lead us and prevent an unfavourable course of events in a timely manner through joint
efforts. </p><p>We should
understand that poverty is growing all over the world today, in countries from
where thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of migrants are moving to Europe and there is a danger that millions of people from Sub-Saharan Africa
may move to Europe in the foreseeable future. If this socioeconomic situation
continues, nothing will hold back this flow of people, nothing will stop them
in their search for a better life. Therefore, it is necessary to think of what
we should do to ensure that people in these countries have acceptable living
standards, that they can have, raise and educate their children, get jobs and enjoy modern living standards. Isn’t this a shared challenge? </p><p>The same
goes for the environment. The Prime Minister said this and all other speakers
here said it and you also gave much prominence to it. It is a real challenge.
We need to understand what is going on there. It is not an easy job. We also
need to work out common rules of conduct. It is very important here – and I believe Christian spoke about this – it is very important to have stability
here and together work out a solution, but then we should move together in carrying it out. We have a lot of unifying agendas, a lot. And if we focus on this, on the positive side of our cooperation, then the world will, without any
doubt, change for the better. </p><p><b>Megyn Kelly: </b>With that, we thank all of you for your attention and your patience. We
thank the beautiful people of St Petersburg for hosting us. And we thank all of you – President Dodon, Chancellor Kern, Prime Minister Modi, and our host
President Putin. Thank you very much.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Many thanks again to our
moderator. </p>   <div class="read__cut read__cut_full_size masha-ignore" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="38506-cut"> <div class="cut"> <h3 class="cut__title" id="38506-cut">See also</h3>   <div class="cut__description">  <a href="/events/president/trips/54691" class="cut__item cut__link" target="_blank">All news about trip to St Petersburg</a> <div class="cut__date">June 1 − 3, 2017</div>  </div>  </div> </div> <div class="read__bottommeta hidden-copy"> <div class="width_limiter">   <div class="read__tags masha-ignore">  <div class="read__tagscol"> <h3>Geography</h3> <ul class="read__taglist"><li><a
