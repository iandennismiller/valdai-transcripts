with representatives of the Russian healthcare sector, patient organisations,
medical educational institutions and medical associations. The meeting
participants discussed a wide range of matters regarding the Russian healthcare
system.</p><p>Before the meeting, the President
toured the medical research centre. Director General Yevgeny Shlyakhto
demonstrated to Vladimir Putin a hybrid operating theatre that is unique in Russia. It is equipped for CT scanning to be carried out during surgery. One of the advantages of hybrid surgery is the ability to perform simultaneous
interventions by several teams in the same operating theatre, which reduces the duration of an operation. This method also reduces the risks of any complications
and cuts the time a patient spends at a hospital.</p><p> The Almazov National Medical Research Centre is one
of Russia’s largest research and medical facilities as well as a multidisciplinary research and clinical centre. The centre provides
multidisciplinary specialised medical help to the public, including hi-tech
procedures. Additionally, the centre conducts fundamental and applied research
in various fields of medicine and trains researchers and medical workers. Every
year, the centre treats over 36,000 patients. Over 170,000 people are received
by the centre’s outpatient clinic.</p><p><b>* * *</b></p><p><i>Excerpts from transcript
of the meeting with healthcare workers</i></p><p><b>President of Russia Vladimir Putin: </b>Friends, good afternoon,</p><p>I hope that you too were shown around the centre where we are today.
Despite the fact that I was directly involved in its establishment and development, it still impresses me a lot. This is exactly what medicine today
needs: a blend of science, education, a clinic as well as personnel training.
Magnificent! It is all these things put together that produce this upscale
effect.</p><p>The goal of our meeting, or this medical roundtable discussion, as I put
it, is the following. If you noticed, in my Address to the Federal Assembly I spoke about priority development areas for Russia and singled out several of them such as infrastructure development: transport, communications, education,
science, high technology and medicine.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/egI8zg898c7h4DbQoTtVEJTNxQUmJMh8.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/8teZU4fR2FmiQMWnlWh1DhjDp48qDviV.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(221, 237, 255);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #ddedff 0%, rgba(221,237,255,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #b6b9ce 0%, rgba(182,185,206,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #504e41 0%, rgba(80,78,65,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #80806c 0%, rgba(128,128,108,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Before visiting Almazov National Medical Research Centre." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Before visiting Almazov National Medical Research Centre."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-03-16"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Before visiting Almazov National Medical Research Centre.</span> </div><p>It is obvious that it is impossible to solve the main humanitarian task
and the state’s mission without healthy people; it is impossible to help people
to live longer and have a high-quality of life; and it is impossible to solve
the key task every country has, ours included: the preservation and development
of the nation.</p><p>In today’s world, healthcare is becoming, or, to tell you the truth, has
already become an economic category. And I do not mean the cost of sick leaves alone
here. I mean that the main motivation in today’s world include advancement in science, technology, robotics and artificial intelligence. An ill person cannot
solve these tasks, just cannot. In this sense, healthcare has a special
mission; it becomes complex.</p><p>You might have noticed that I have recently met with representatives from
the transport complex in Moscow, talked with agriculture representatives and the agroindustrial complex in Krasnodar and met with representatives from the academic community in Novosibirsk. Before preparing the new edition of the 2012
executive orders, which you remember, we will need to prepare new goals based
on the things we have done and the matters we are facing today. So, while
meeting people from various professional fields, I wanted to meet people
working in healthcare, too, with people doing practical work.</p><p>I have just issued instructions to the Government and the Executive Office, and the work on specific executive orders on the areas of activity, on sectors, including healthcare, medicine, will get underway.</p><p>I would like to hold a free, open conversation with you today. I would like to listen to your thoughts, your opinions and your recommendations on what we should do in the near future and how, in your opinion.</p><p>If we talk about the year 2012 and these executive orders, then one of the most important components was wage levels in the healthcare sector. As you remember, the point was that doctors should receive exactly twice as much as the average in a corresponding region. I know about part-time employment problems, I know that not everything has been done, but still, progress has been made, it is noticeable, obvious.</p><p>What would I like to say in this regard? If this bar were not so rigidly fixed, then we would not have achieved today’s result, because when there is no clear guidance and clear instructions about what we need to achieve, we go along general terms. As a rule, such things do not get special attention.</p><p>In this connection, I would like to say and emphasise that with an increase in wages in regional economies, the Government will strive to ensure that the achieved level does not decrease but gradually rises. This is for starters.</p><p>Before we begin the conversation, I would like to say the following. As you know, a new state decoration has been established in Russia – the badge of merit For Mentorship. And I am very pleased to note that such a badge is being awarded to your colleague, Rector of Samara State Medical University, Academician Gennady Kotelnikov. He is an outstanding doctor, a true teacher and a mentor who has trained more than 80 scientists in the field of medicine, 25 Doctors of Science and brought up a long line of wonderful doctors.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/UKmJOsV1hrr5qgMoPCHsVRcIK3n3ehPA.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/HARl3veg729LJzYK11ynJkzRthnWE2WC.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(209, 223, 220);background:linear-gradient(0deg, #d1dfdc 0%, rgba(209,223,220,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #7d704d 0%, rgba(125,112,77,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #3b312e 0%, rgba(59,49,46,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #f8d2b4 0%, rgba(248,210,180,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="During a visit to the Almazov National Medical Research Centre." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="During a visit to the Almazov National Medical Research Centre."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-03-16"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">During a visit to the Almazov National Medical Research Centre.</span> </div><p>I would like to congratulate you from the bottom of my heart.</p><p><b>Speaker: </b>In accordance with the Presidential Executive a badge of merit For Mentorship is presented to Gennady Kotelnikov, rector of Samara State Medical University, for his services in teaching young professionals and active mentor activities. <i>(Applause.)</i></p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Mr Kotelinkov, I would like to congratulate you once again, thank you for your many years of work and I wish you every success.</p><p>Let’s begin, please, go ahead.</p><p><b>Yelena Kleshchenko: </b>Good afternoon to everyone once again. I represent the Krasnodar Territory. Yelena Kleshchenko, head doctor at the Children’s Regional Clinical Hospital.</p><p>First of all, Mr President, I must say that we were very encouraged about the declared Decade of Childhood. When we discussed it with colleagues, we thought it was a very good sign for our sector.</p><p>I would also like to thank you for launching the unique perinatal centre construction project which is almost completed in Russia. We were in the first phase: our perinatal centre is seven years old. I believe we make a huge contribution into lowering the infant mortality rate: it was 4.3 in the Krasnodar Territory last year, and we are very proud of this.</p><p>It seems to us that implementing more high technology into our field would be a breakthrough in helping children and reducing infant mortality and cases of disability. But this would require new medical buildings.</p><p>I know that 17 Russian regions have no local children’s hospital at all, and children are treated at clinics for adults; this is why I am asking you, Mr President, with hope. Are there plans to build any children’s hospitals like perinatal centres?</p><p>And, if you allow, another question. It is a very acute and serious topic for us: there is not enough medicine especially for children. As you know, when a pediatrician prescribes medicine, he or she writes the dose: milligrammes or millilitres per kilo of the body mass, and this body mass can be 500–600 grammes or 30–40 kilogrammes. This is why the lack of medicine for children is a grave and worrying matter for pediatricians. And I would like this problem to be discussed at the highest level.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/tg8emftjwnQh92A5fsC6PBA01kNOVn2i.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/NvDT8BfCazPpBRQiCNmC2ljq6sK1Ifod.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(234, 250, 249);background:linear-gradient(0deg, #eafaf9 0%, rgba(234,250,249,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #e0ccb2 0%, rgba(224,204,178,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #80815f 0%, rgba(128,129,95,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #d49377 0%, rgba(212,147,119,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Visit to Almazov National Medical Research Centre." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Visit to Almazov National Medical Research Centre."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-03-16"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Visit to Almazov National Medical Research Centre.</span> </div><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Ms Kleshchenko, first of all, I would like you to note that the healthcare in the Krasnodar Territory is good in general. There probably are
some problems, but in any case, your regional hospital can serve as a good
example of how the healthcare sector must develop in the regions. You have
everything there. Very good experienced specialists and good equipment. To tell
you the truth, when I found out more about this, I was glad that we have got such
centres in the regions.</p><p>Speaking about the perinatal centre,
you know that it was difficult to establish it although it has been working for seven years. At the beginning there were several mistakes, to put it mildly,
that had to be corrected along the way, but we have managed it. To be quite
frank with you, this is a good example demonstrating that every right and good
deed has a few stumbling blocks to overcome. And we must never give up; we must
move forward and achieve results. And when we set these goals, we always manage
to do it. The example of your perinatal centre is very good, it proves these
words.</p><p>Speaking about children’s hospitals,
clinics and so forth. You must have heard, I spoke about it maybe two months
ago that we will allocate additional money to re-equip children’s clinics and departments at hospitals during 2018, 2019 and 2020 especially for this.</p><p>This means an additional 10 billion
from the federal budget during these years. On March 1, if I am not mistaken,
or not very long ago anyway, the government issued the corresponding instruction.</p><p><i>(To Healthcare Minister Veronika Skvortsova.) </i>Ms Skvortsova, did you get that instruction
out yet? It envisages 10 billion for 2018. I said and I would like to say it
once again, that these funds are allocated for re-equipping children’s
hospitals and departments at hospitals.</p><p>You have spoken about construction. The government instruction and my instruction did not include construction. The only thing I am concerned with, and please do not get me wrong, I do not want
to offend anyone, I am just afraid that this money will be used on endless
construction, and not to re-equip, train specialists or fix what there already
is.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is very difficult
to check up on such things as shrinkage, spillage and resorting. Although, we
must probably think how to organise it in some cases where there is nothing
yet. Maybe, we may reconstruct something, or maybe, combine hospitals already
available. I do not object in general, but you must be very careful with this
construction.</p><p>Speaking about childhood and children, I said that additional 10 billion will be allocated. The decision for this year has been made.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/OqAdwBTrPeBuwX37kAATe3pAnyC1vdJR.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/rgvoolGm4wdwEXdVxKSADWBKBAQRchtL.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(192, 190, 146);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #c0be92 0%, rgba(192,190,146,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #898852 0%, rgba(137,136,82,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #49552f 0%, rgba(73,85,47,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #5e7e71 0%, rgba(94,126,113,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Visit to Almazov National Medical Research Centre.

There is a federal programme called Pharma. It is strange that it
does not contain a section on children’s medicines. It must be added.</p><p>Do you have this section?</p><p><b>Healthcare Minister Veronika Skvortsova:</b> There is a section on medicines for children.
There are 640 registered medicines for children, including 79 developed
exclusively for children. Five or six new medicines are registered every year.
There are anti-viral, anti-bacterial and other types of medicines being
registered. We are monitoring the registration and will extend the list every
year, by all means.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I think it is necessary that doctors are promptly informed. It often
happens that something new has been developed but nobody knows about it.</p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova:</b> Of course, it will be done.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> So, we have this area covered. It just needs to be improved. We will do
as required.</p><p>Please.</p><p><b>Valentina Zherebtsova:</b> Mr President, I would like to support my colleague. My name is
Valentina Zherebtsova. I work at the Children’s Neuropsychiatry Centre in Tula.</p><p>I would like to support the request
for not only constructing new and equipping existing children’s hospitals but
also doing the same for children’s rehabilitation centres. Even more so because
in the past years, a lot has been done in this area. There are clinical
protocols for monitoring patients and professional standards in place.</p><p>Modern technology is widely used in children’s rehabilitation. There are early treatment and diagnosis programmes.
Therefore, we are witnessing some very significant changes. Of course, providing
children’s rehabilitation facilities with newer equipment and constructing new
facilities is a very important matter, in my opinion.</p><p>However, my question is not about
that. There are entire groups of specialists who are categorised as paramedics,
such as speech therapists and neuropsychologists. They are full-fledged
participants of the rehabilitation programme and the rehabilitation process.</p><p>Up until now, these specialists have
been trained at teacher-training universities or dedicated university
departments. I believe it is important to train such specialists at medical universities
for subsequent employment with the medical rehabilitation system …</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
I agree with you. Speech therapists are trained at teacher-training
universities, and they major in what I believe is called ”speech therapy

Assembly you mentioned cancer treatment. And you said that there was a need…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Sorry to interrupt you. This is an area where unfortunately we have yet to achieve the results people expect from us. This is true. While we have made
major progress on vascular diseases, and we have achieved a breakthrough, there
is also some progress in cancer treatment, but not the kind of progress we
would like to see.</p><p>Sorry for interrupting. Please,
continue.</p><p><b>Arcady Stolpner</b>: In fact, I wanted to talk about the positive developments.</p><p>When this disease strikes any of us,
our friends or relatives, it is a tragedy. It gets even worse when dealing with
cancer in children. But new methods for treating oncological diseases have been
developed recently. Proton beam therapy is one example, often mentioned by Ms
Skvortsova. Children are the focus groups for this therapy, and it is often the method of choice when treating cancer in children. </p><p>We built the first
oncological centre in Russia in this format. You said that construction can be
complicated, but in fact we built it in a Europe-like timeframe: it took us four
years to open it. Now we treat patients, even young ones. The city helped a lot. I must say that this was only possible because Georgy Poltavchenko [St
Petersburg governor] helped us personally in certain areas, where monopolists
and other issues were concerned.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/SeB7FAADuPlMFUbi7LCk0a8yCZtZG2Qs.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/CfoKMJehNEHarbRZyTdaQyBtMY1X0Aro.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(160, 129, 133);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #a08185 0%, rgba(160,129,133,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #262b44 0%, rgba(38,43,68,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #cce0eb 0%, rgba(204,224,235,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #07b0b2 0%, rgba(7,176,178,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Meeting with healthcare sector workers.

Minister of Healthcare Veronika Skvortsova.</span> </div><p>Based on the decisions
of Mr Poltavchenko and the city administration – because the money has been
allocated to treat patients with oncology – all children who need this
treatment will be treated at state expense starting this year. For example,
today we have ten patients: eight are being treated at no cost and two are being
prepared for treatment on St Petersburg’s account. Maybe it is possible to solve this problem at the federal level too? I know that such work is being
done, but maybe it could be moved accelerated.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I have focused on this, even in my Address, but of course, we will allocate money for this. But these are specific
decisions; they must be made by the Healthcare Ministry. We will allocate
additional resources, but it is up to the ministry to decide how to use them,
with specialists of course, taking into account that special attention must be
paid to oncology. I hope your words will also be considered.</p><p><b><b>Arcady Stolpner</b>:</b> If I may I would like to add
something. In fact, there are few ill children, so this problem, in this narrow
area, can be resolved with relatively little money.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We both know that when the state
focuses on something specific, there will be certain results, and generally these
are good results.</p><p><i>Pediatric hematology</i>/<i>oncology</i> can serve as the best example. How many patients were
there before we opened the Rogachev Centre and how many are there now?</p><p><b>Alexander Rumyantsev</b>: Let me begin with what we have
now. Today the survival rate in the Russian Federation is between 80 and 90
percent. These are people who get well after an oncological disease.</p><p>Mr President, I would
like to thank you for your support. You always say that you like us and check
on us. I would like to say that this is a great responsibility for us.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Everyone likes a doctor,
especially a good one.</p><p><b>Alexander Rumyantsev:</b> Yes, this is a big responsibility
for us. We are trying to do everything we can, because the model we have
implemented along with the Healthcare Ministry is important for every Russian
region. We have 59 regions, along with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Armenia, that treat patients based on the same standard protocols and under the same financial conditions. These protocols are adjusted every year due to new discoveries
in medicine.</p><p>What were the reasons behind this
success? We are talking about every child currently living in Russia. Thanks to the centre that was built under your supervision, which is now essentially
ours, we have implemented a whole series of projects. This supports the full
range of morphological examinations for children.</p><p>The Healthcare Ministry helped us a lot by making sure that we receive funds to provide patients with the second, the so-called morphological examination. Which means that a child, who lives
somewhere else, gets diagnosed, and we conduct a second examination at our
institution in order to gather full information on the child.</p><p>For the first time in Russia, we
have implemented a rehabilitation project for children who survived cancer. It
is an incredible project, which is giving us a lot of information about special
methods of rehabilitation that every child who survived cancer needs. Last May,
we opened the first ever centre for rehabilitation of infants who survived
cancer. No other country has a centre like this.</p><p>I would like to take this
opportunity to say that these models, which we use to treat children, and we
have about 4,500 new patients a year, can be used to treat adults as well.
Cancer in adults is a major issue, because each year, there are almost 600,000
new adult cancer patients.</p><p>This is a very broad programme,
which you called a principal programme, and it really is principal for the development of the entire healthcare sphere, after the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>I also take this opportunity to invite you over. You have not visited us in a long while, and we would like to show you what we have done, show some things off, and, perhaps, discuss with
you some matters related to the further pursuit of our cause.</p><p>Our cause is to make every child
healthy again. And we would like to show you how one can organise the work, the key component of which is love, love for children.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Are you creating a rehabilitation centre?</p><p><b>Alexander Rumyantsev:</b> Yes. It has been in operation for four years, the progress is slow, but
I want to tell you: together with their parents, a total of 2,500 children from
85 Russian regions undergo treatment in this centre every day. It is an additional trip, since the centre is located outside the city, but I think that
it is worth seeing, seeing how everything is organised. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> It was not always easy with this centre: the issue of location, the issue of financing.</p><p><b>Alexander Rumyantsev:</b> But now it is. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Thank God that it is now, I am very happy about that. I will definitely
come see it.</p><p>Please. </p><p><b>Yevgeny Shlyakhto</b>: Mr President, I am probably expressing a common opinion when I thank
you for supporting our professional community.</p><p>I would like to draw your attention
to the fact that you focused on patients in your Address. This is a key trend
in our healthcare today. Our model of healthcare is patient-oriented; we are
moving away from the model that focused on the doctor to a model centred on the patient. Everything should be tailored to patients and their individual
circumstances.</p><p>Second, I would like to mention the specifics of Russian healthcare. Close ties with scientific research are part
of our tradition, and our goal is to make them permanent. I believe that the changes taking place in Russia today are the result of breakthrough
developments in creating innovative medical technologies, diagnostics, and medicines. These changes are rapid, and everyone who comes to Russia sees and recognises
them.</p><p>We will have an edited T-lymphocyte
a year from now. This is absolutely unparalleled technology. There are already pharmaceutical
companies that work with research centres and universities and create new medicines.
So, this is critically important.</p><p>How can all of this be promoted in the Russian regions? The Healthcare Ministry decided (and we all support this decision)
to create national medical research centres. Thank you for supporting this
decision. This is not about someone being more important, and someone else being
less important. We need to create a healthcare network for each region with account
taken for its specifics, to identify the best practices in a region, to develop
them and replicate the achievements that are currently available in the world.</p><p>I believe that the role of national
medical centres is to unite, help, and train staff, to develop and to promote innovative
technology so it becomes readily available. So, thank you very much for the directive
that you signed on the importance of training at research centres, we talked
about this.</p><p>Last, I believe that we have vast
opportunities to develop digital healthcare. Vast. We already have many
decision support systems in our country. This applies to hospitals, emergency
care, and patients with severe disorders, especially in remote regions. I am
sure that counselling will help significantly reduce mortality rates within the next year or two.</p><p>We have reduced cardiovascular
mortality by 35 percent. Everyone just cannot believe that this is true. I recently attended the spring summit of the European Society of Cardiology and told them about the 35 percent, and they cannot understand how it can be
possible. “How did you achieve this figure?” they asked. We still have
problems, but we should reduce it by another 30–40 percent in the coming years,
and we will do it.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We spoke about the centres today, when we inspected your centre. The Healthcare
Ministry created 20 such centres throughout the territory of the Russian
Federation. Where are they in the Far East? In Tomsk. Where else?</p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova:</b> Tomsk, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, Siberia and the whole European part. Today we
already mentioned this; now we need to link all these centres. This is first.</p><p>And second, it is necessary that
these centres are connected with relevant institutions in the regions. We need
to create a single medical complex so that, as you rightly said, your colleague
in any, even a small clinic, has the opportunity to enter a specialised
network, get advice, send data on patients for monitoring and treatment
purposes. I am confident that this will play a very visible, serious role.</p><p>We have been talking about the digitalisation of life in general, of the economy in all its manifestations and the various spheres of our life and activity, including healthcare. So,
something is already happening here, it is already noticeable, but it is not
enough.</p><p>We will develop a separate programme
for the digitalisation of healthcare. As far as I know, the Ministry has
already prepared an additional draft resolution, which will be directly related
to this type of activity. We just need to speed up its adoption. Is it already with
the Government or still with the Ministry?</p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova:</b> By April 1, it will be considered in the Government.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> So, the project has been developed and will be released in April.</p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova:</b> Yes.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Please.</p><p><b>Vladimir Goryachev: </b>Can I say a few words? I would like to continue with childhood
cardiology.</p><p>Vladimir Goryachev, head doctor of the Samara Regional Clinical Cardiology Centre.</p><p>I must add that 12 years ago we
created a system of organised help for children with congenital heart defects
at our centre. Over the succeeding five or six years the waiting list for these
procedures all but disappeared.</p><p>We had a history of participation in various state programmes dedicated to motherhood and childhood. I am afraid
that without these programmes we would not have been able to reach this level
of medical support. Today we operate on almost all children’s congenital heart
defects, including new-borns with defects that were considered fatal not long
ago. Now it is clear that survival is possible with 95 percent of them.</p><p>I believe that we would have
overcome these difficulties one way or another, but the existing programmes included
additional financing, additional equipment and personnel training so we reached
this level with fewer losses and in a shorter time, let me put it that way.</p><p>We continue to feel your concern.
Thank you very much for this. This is clear because I believe a society’s
maturity is determined by how it regards its most vulnerable people: children
and seniors. Primarily children, or course, because they are our future.</p><p>Today we have a large programme to update polyclinics for children; let’s hope this will continue. Thank you very
much, not from me of course, I am just the messenger, but from the entire paediatric
community in Russia.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Thank you.</p><p>Mr Goryachev, we have really done
something, especially at these centres; we have already talked about several
other children’s centres. This is a great level; it is really something to be
proud of. It is not by chance that we are allocating an additional 10 billion
each year, starting with this one, for children’s healthcare, because the situation at local children’s polyclinics and hospitals is, to put it mildly,
far from perfect.</p><p>By the way, this is why we must
continue supporting the large centres regularly as this money is distributed
(this is additional money), because we are proud of them and they must become a methodological base for developing children’s healthcare.</p><p>Among other things, and maybe most
importantly, we are allocating 10 billion rubles to raise the level of children’s healthcare in municipalities, at polyclinics, hospitals and paediatric
departments at general hospitals. I would like to focus on this. Now we must
take the next step: expand the opportunities we have in children’s healthcare
today.</p><p>Please, go ahead.</p><p><b>President of the National Medical Chamber Leonid Roshal</b>: Mr President, many thanks for convening this meeting and, in general, for much of what you have actually done
for our healthcare.</p><p>During our most recent meeting, you
promised to increase funding for healthcare. I am pleased to note that your
actions are as good as your words, and everything is going well. What you did –
achieving incrementally 5 percent of GDP for healthcare needs by 2025 – is
nothing short of great. We have discussed these issues with you. This is our
longstanding dream.</p><p>Without this, a breakthrough in healthcare can hardly be expected. Of course, we need to use this money wisely.
We did not forget that it was your decision to completely re-equip healthcare facilities
in Russia, which was effectively accomplished.</p><p>Notably, we like to exceed our
target plans, and not just with regard to the Crimean Bridge. It was nice. We
will not object if you have the chance to exceed the target figures for healthcare financing in the future. We don’t want it to look like you offer a finger and we bite off your hand. We are talking based on reality.</p><p>I am convinced that we are treating patients
better every year, and the equipment is better, but the number of complaints increases.
Frankly, this is not the case just in our country, but worldwide. Complaints
about healthcare are on the rise in Germany, Great Britain, and the United
States. This is because today the demands are high, off the chart occasionally.
The number of complaints and criminal cases is increasing, I believe,
artificially, not because we are treating our patients worse: we are treating them
better every year, but the media instigates.</p><p><i>(Leonid Roshal went on to discuss specific issues related, in particular, to medical mistakes and legal issues, staff shortages and safety of medical workers.)</i></p><p>Along with the Healthcare Ministry,
we are overhauling the training system. This is something we can really make
happen. The requirements for higher education are getting tougher. We believe
that doctors must engage in lifelong learning, which has never been the case in Russia. We are introducing a continuous medical training system, which should
be convenient and free for doctors.</p><p>We are working on professional
standards and compliance with education standards; occupational clearance,
which is also new for us; new approaches to performance reviews and assignment
of qualification grades; and the development of clinical recommendations for treatment protocols. The National Medical Chamber has already assumed
responsibility for these areas of work.</p><p>Even though with the difficulties, the public-private form of managing professional healthcare is being introduced
with a gradual transition to self-regulation, and we are grateful to you for supporting these undertakings. We have found common language with patient
organisations. We invite them, they invite us, and we pursue the same goals.</p><p>Mr President, we clearly see our challenges
and know how to overcome them. I am confident that we will see to it that the people of Russia are satisfied with healthcare and doctors.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Indeed, the National Medical Chamber is an accomplished entity, congratulations,
because this project is your brainchild in the broadest sense of the word.</p><p>The concerns expressed by the officials of the Healthcare Ministry and its regional structures, never came true.
The National Medical Chamber has become part of life and is playing an essential part as an indicator of the quality of work and protects the interests of medical workers. You mentioned this as well and expressed your
concerns. I will go over them briefly.</p><p>Transferring certain functions from
state entities to such an authoritative non-profit organisation as the Medical
Chamber is, of course, an important area of developing the National Medical
Chamber. As we have already discussed, we will need to follow this path gradually
as solutions to these and other issues become available. I support this.</p><p>Now a few words about increasing the funding for healthcare. There is no need to curse anyone, there are no enemies
here and in general there are no enemies of healthcare in the Government,
including the Finance Ministry, as I have said more than once. It’s a matter of counting.</p><p>If you add up healthcare funding
from all sources it is over 5 percent. This is the problem. It depends on how you
count it. It is simply necessary to make sure that my colleagues in the Government and all of us understand what this is about.</p><p>Regarding pure budget funding, it
will be much less. Some analysts believe it was 3.2 percent last year. </p><p><b>Remark</b>: 3.3.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
I will not go into details now. Believe me, we have fought and argued over all
of these issues so much.</p><p>What would I like to assure you of?
We will do everything we can for the funding of healthcare to be real rather
than on paper. We realise how important this is and will do all we can to use
even additional funds – and they are already appearing – to spend part of these
additional funds on resolving healthcare problems.</p><p>I said in the Address that this is a priority area, not just for effect, not to please those that need medical care or the medical community. We really believe, and I personally believe, that this
is one of the most important areas of national development. We will do this by any
means possible.</p><p>Now a few words about growing
requirements. This is always the case. Do not get mad at anyone. This is always
so. When there is nothing, everything is okay. But when things start moving and something is developing, as soon as people begin to understand that there is a different life and different opportunities, they immediately look not at what
they had yesterday – this is quickly forgotten – but at what they can get tomorrow.
These are the lawful requirements of the people, and we should be guided by these legal requirements.</p><p>You said that some specialized questionable
companies, even legal ones, are emerging and extorting money from the healthcare system and medical workers. Regrettably, this is the negative side
of any process that is being funded in a systematic way.</p><p>As soon as money appears somewhere,
parasite companies emerge and try to take a bite of the money in one way or another. But we must counter this. We will pay attention to this and try to prevent
anything like this from happening.</p><p>Naturally, the security of medical
workers should be ensured and responsibility for damages increased. We will see
how the latest decisions will work in practice and will toughen the requirements if necessary, as well as prosecution for attacks on medical
workers in any form.</p><p>A few words about the Accounts
Chamber. The Accounts Chamber is designed to analyse the efficiency of government spending, spending budget funds, federal funds in the first place.
It does not make final decisions but only keeps us informed. Decisions are made
by other instances that have an opportunity to assess objectively the information they get from the Accounts Chamber. So, there should be no serious
apprehensions in this respect.</p><p>Go ahead please.</p><p><b>Oleg Karpov</b>:
Oleg Karpov, director of the Pirogov Centre.</p><p>Mr President, thank you very much
for your words of gratitude to medical workers for which you found room in your
Address to the Federal Assembly. We hear them and this is very important for us.</p><p>We, everyone here, remembers the 1990s and what life was like then – regrettably, it was difficult to survive at that time. We were essentially craftsmen and saved our patients only by resorting to art and intellect. Everything has changed since the 2000s. </p><p>And indeed, returning to your Address
again, by adopting systematic and consistent measures and facing the problems
of the industry, you took us into the orbit of technological development that
allowed Russian healthcare to match European and world standards. This is true.</p><p>Today we treat three to four times
more patients on the same number of beds and the number of operations has increased
as much. Today we treat our patients as we could not before and receive results
that seemed fantastic 12 or 15 years ago. </p><p>These are not just words. Here is a fact. Our centre is well developed and famous. In the early 2000s there was a pool of patients who came to us for final tests and then went abroad for medical treatment at their own expense. </p><p>In a few years – and this evokes an unusual
feeling of pride and joy – these patients stopped leaving. They stopped leaving
because now the latest medical aid, all technology is available in Russia – the same equipment, the same standards and the same medicines. Yes, there are some
exclusive medicines or equipment in some places, but they will become available.</p><p>Inbound tourism is important in this
respect. In our industry we have tens of thousands of patients in the federal
centres alone. These are major financial injections. Our industry received
about 16 billion rubles in 2016.</p><p>About 3,000 foreign patients have come
to our centre in two years, including 750 that arrived to be treated for multiple sclerosis. We developed our own technology for such treatment and received license for it. It is being used in several places in the world.
Patients from the United States, Canada, Norway, France and Spain come to us
and wait for treatment with this technology. This is a very good resource, for our earnings as well.</p><p>I believe against this rapid
increase in economic efficiency we should not forget that the moral and ethical
factor of communication between the doctor and the patient, the medical worker
and the patient also remains a priority. By tradition this was inherent in our
domestic healthcare. The human factor has always played a special role and we
consistently pay attention to it. </p><p>And, finally, one more point, Mr
President. You said in your Address that financial allocations are required for us to keep up with this rate of technological development. We are talking about
this today. This is certainly the case, but probably apart from efficient
government spending broader use must be made of private funds and this is what
we are doing.</p><p><i>(Oleg Karpov went on to describe the public-private partnership at the Pirogov Centre.)</i></p><p>Now departments are jointly and actively working through public-private partnerships. We would like to ask you
to keep these issues under your personal control so that they are duly
completed, and we will start consistent and confident work in these areas.</p><p>And the last point. Naturally, it is
indicative that you are meeting with us, medical workers in the last hours of such a complicated political time. Thank you for keeping us a priority as before.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Thank you.</p><p>I mentioned my recent meeting with
transport workers, the agro-industrial complex, and earlier with researchers
and educators. That's why our meeting is more like a staff meeting, but of course, a special one, bearing in mind that we need to articulate our goals for the next six years.</p><p>So, I am sincerely saying that, of course, we constantly discuss this with the Minister and the Deputy Prime
Minister who are present, and the Prime Minister and our colleagues from other
ministries and departments. We do argue a lot, but listening to people who do
things with their own hands is particularly valuable.</p><p>That is why I meet with
representatives from various industries. Of course, we must follow our domestic
political schedule, but we just need to formulate our goals for the next six
years. I hope – and it turns out that way – that we are talking about what we
believe are the most important, interesting, promising and essential things
that need to be done.</p><p>You mentioned public-private
partnership. Of course, this must be promoted. However, we should not forget
that we must use a certain set of tools to make sure that people can have
access to free medical care in our country. This is a legal requirement, and we
must follow it. At the same time, of course, it is necessary to develop all alternatives,
including public-private partnerships.</p><p>Of course, private investors expect a return on their investment. In this regard, I fully agree with you that inbound
medical tourism is extremely interesting and important, including to improve
the well-being of those who work in the medical industry.</p><p>The international medical tourism
market is estimated at about $10.5 billion. In 2016, Russia accounted for only
$250 million despite your findings; $10.5 billion was in 2016, now it is
probably more. And we had just $250 million coming our way. By the way, our
possibilities for this are vast.</p><p>This will grow if we will act
purposefully in this area. It will definitely help not only those who come for medical help to Russia from abroad, but it will also raise the overall level of our healthcare, because the standards will be fairly high.</p><p>In this regard, it is important for us not only to provide high quality medical care, but to also promote rehabilitation
services. We are still behind your colleagues in this area, that is why centres
such as the Dima Rogachev Centre and others are making a point of this issue.</p><p>Are you also contemplating a rehabilitation
centre? This is critically important. This is important for your potential patients
and medical tourists, both future and current. If you want them to come, you
need to figure this out, but, of course, do not forget about the core activity –
medical care. </p><p>Now I want to get back to finance issues
in general. I already mentioned it earlier, and we will definitely focus on this,
not just focus, but allocate additional resources. Your ideas on public-private
partnership should in no way replace state funding, but they will complement
the general efforts of the state to promote healthcare.</p><p><b>Ivan Stilidi</b>: Mr President, I am Ivan Stilidi,
acting Head of the Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Centre. I would like the words of gratitude to be more pronounced. They are from all those involved in oncology. Thank you
very much for seeing that oncology has been included on the list of priority
areas of the development in medicine, and in general, the state is paying much
attention to it.</p><p>I must say we were ready for this because
everyone in the professional community who has devoted years of their life, their
mind and soul is always waiting for their cause to be a priority. In this sense,
oncologists have lived to see this. We were also ready for this because the full
modernisation of oncological institutions began in 2009 and these steps have
already produced results.</p><p>Some of my colleagues are here. They
are directors at national oncology centres: Andrei Kaprin from the Hertzen Centre
and Alexei Belyayev from the Petrov Institute. And, of course we are now working
with the fresh impetus that you have given us on developing a national anticancer
programme and building a fundamental federal anticancer service. Naturally,
together, we are a powerful force. I believe this new impetus should produce
results. Once again thank you very much on behalf of all oncologists.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Thank you for recalling the past
decisions on consolidating oncology centres and early treatment clinics. It is,
of course, a pleasure to hear that you felt that at least something has been
done there and that you see results. As we agreed, we will take the next step
by all means possible. I have already determined this as a priority and we will
work together on it.</p><p><b>Sergei Boitsov</b>:
Sergei Boitsov, Director of the Russian National Medical Research Center of Cardiology and at the same time chief
visiting specialist of the Healthcare Ministry on preventive medicine. </p><p>I would like to speak primarily about
preventive medicine and issues in primary care. This is what I will start with,
since the issue of accessibility in this regard is most urgent. </p><p>In the past three months alone, you
have addressed this issue twice – during your news conference and in your
Address to the Federal Assembly. The problem began to develop in the early
2000s, not now. At that time there were 43,000 first aid/obstetric stations, now
there are 36,000 stations but the reduction took place in the first years of this century.</p><p>In the past few years, the Healthcare
Ministry tried to restore the balance and opened almost 900 stations in the last two years alone. But now we are receiving a powerful additional impetus
and thank you very much Mr President – the Government of the Russian Federation
has issued a resolution on making a significant financial injection of 1.2
billion on these stations alone. We have confidence that in two years or in two
and a half years at most the problems will be resolved – of course, with the participation of the regions.</p><p>No less important is the matter of mobile stations. They are needed for 1.7 million people in 65 regions. The number of stations is growing at a good pace: there were 1,400 mobile stations four
years ago and now there are 3,500. But at least 1,800 are still needed.</p><p>There has also been a financial injection
of 2.2 billion. It will be possible to launch about 200 stations this year. So,
thank you very much for your special attention to this issue.</p><p>Another issue, which you also
mentioned in your Address to the Federal Assembly, is preventive medical examinations.
In 2012, the country resumed the regular large-scale system of preventive medical
check-ups for the adult population. Originally, it was organised every three
years. This year, we are launching a parallel campaign of oncological screening
every two years. </p><p>This involves preventive
examinations and health centres. In total, 36 million adults have medical
check-ups annually. This is not only detection of diseases and risk factors but
also promoting a healthy life style, which we call our number one goal. </p><p>Children as well, over 30 million
children get medical check-ups annually. This also promotes a healthy life
style. </p><p>I would like to thank you again for your special attention to this issue. </p><p>We have two requests. The first one concerns
promoting the law on salt iodisation. This is a very important issue for our
country. 113 countries have already adopted the salt iodisation law. This not
only prevents thyroid diseases but also solves intellectual development
problems. At least 15–20 percent of our population lives in iodine deficiency
zones. We consume three times less iodine in Russia than necessary. </p><p>At the initiative and with the active
participation of academician Ivan Dedov, the Ministry of Healthcare has submitted
a supplement to the law on food quality and safety. We are asking for your
support, Mr President, because we do not rule out difficulty in passing this
law. </p><p>Similarly, a hard road lies ahead of another document, which is not a law but a strategy for promoting a healthy
life style and preventing and controlling non-contagious diseases. This
document involves a large number of participants, such as agencies, services,
public organisations and so on, all of them having many interests. This
document is also passing through several departments with difficulty. We need
support here as well.</p><p> Thank you very much.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Yes, everything you said is very important. I do not even know what to focus on. </p><p>Prevention of non-contagious
diseases. We have addressed this issue already. I know about the internal
difficulties, all these traps and pitfalls, we will tackle them by all means. I agree with you, this is a very important area. </p><p>As for the law or decision on iodised
salt, Mr Dedov is handling this, promoting it as a person who has been working
in this area all his life. This idea did not com about yesterday. We prepared a bill in 2013, but it was actually blocked due to the position of our industry
that it would considerably raise the cost of production. </p><p>I agree with you that we should
follow up on this issue by all means. Indeed, we have a lot of regions situated
quite far away from the sea and people need this. I believe that such
programmes were in force and all this was produced in the USSR. </p><p>We should follow up on this issue by all means because, what can I say, Mr Dedov raises these issues for good
reason. This does not only concern the thyroid gland, but people’s overall health.
So we will follow up on this. Good that you remembered about it. </p><p>Concerning the promotion of a healthy
lifestyle. This is crucial. I agree with our colleagues who say it is time to organise this in such a way that it would do more than just encourage people to take up fitness and sport – every individual is responsible for their health. That
is how things are in the rest of the world.</p><p>We need to steadily, easily in terms
of finance build up a system that will increase peoples’ responsibility for their own health. This is the next point that you took notice of. I find it important.</p><p>Next, concerning preventive
screenings. You know, I do not intend to go into detail, I also mentioned in the Address that it is necessary to initiate a system of preventive screenings.</p><p>We even argued about the proper term
and finally agreed on exactly this phrase – preventive screening, and not
something else, not “annual medical examination.” I will not go into detail; I believe
you understand what this is about. But there is a difference between annual
medical examination and preventive screening.</p><p>Anyway, it is not that important what
we call it. What is important is a different matter – what would happen next? So,
if they diagnose something, what comes next? The system must be ready to respond
to identified problems. And this is a different story, different funds.</p><p>What does different mean? It is the healthcare system. Mr Roshal raised this point; he always raises questions of funding
whenever we meet, I am even scared of him because he always brings up money.</p><p>I mentioned rural and mobile health
stations. We can estimate how much that costs. Not only can we count, it has
already been calculated. We know how much it costs today. We know how much the informatisation
and digitalisation of medicine will cost. These are accounting items, and it is
all there – we will need to allocate this much in the following years to this
and that. And what other things do we have funding for? This is actually
professional analysis with the need to determine the top priorities at this
time.</p><p>You mentioned the primary level in healthcare. We funded it in due time hoping that just like with the primary
level in education it would be taken on by the regions. However, this did not
happen in a lot of cases. We have to go back to that again and allocate funds from
the federal budget. We have to build a system of preserving the achieved level
and of improving this situation in the future. These are the things to work on.
</p><p>All the issues you have raised are
important and interesting; we will certainly be working hard on them, including
the law on iodised salt. This is not a side issue, I agree with you.</p><p>Please, go ahead.</p><p><b>Ildar Khairullin</b>: I am Ildar Khairullin, Chief Doctor at the Republic’s Oncology Clinic,
in Kazan.</p><p>Mr President, six years ago, in February 2012 you visited the Emergency Clinic in Naberezhnye Chelny and set a goal for this clinic to become one of Russia’s best. I can now report to you that in 2015 the clinic passed international accreditation of patient
safety quality and is the first and only state clinic in Russia with a JCI
standard rating.</p><p>Currently, I work at the oncology
clinic. Your Address set out an undoubtedly very ambitious and interesting
challenge to enter the 80+ Club. And you immediately offered a solution – annual
preventive screenings and proposed a national oncology programme.</p><p>Undoubtedly, cancer treatment today drives
healthcare development and presents a consistent approach, from the early
diagnosis of malignant tumours, work within the primary network, specialist
high-tech medical aid, rehabilitation and palliative care. We have everything
here, and this expertise can be applied to other medical services and other
non-infectious diseases.</p><p><i>(I. Khairullin went on to speak about the oncological medical services
in Tatarstan, specifically about annual medical examinations).</i></p><p>We are grateful to the Health
Ministry and Ms. Skvortsova for last year’s resolution, and we noticed the results this year in the increased funding for chemotherapy. This year,
inpatient clinics received an extra 275 million roubles, which allowed us to introduce innovative chemotherapy medication in the key areas. </p><p>At the same time, we are fully aware
of the fact that rates for chemotherapy medication are growing steadily, new
innovative target and immunity drug therapy is being developed. But the rates are
unfortunately lagging behind the cost of this medication.</p><p>Therefore, we need to ask you to speed up the development of domestic innovative target chemotherapy and radiotherapy
medication. On the other hand, we would like you to set up an agency that would
evaluate the financial efficiency of introducing a certain type of treatment or medication in terms of cost and productivity.</p><p>Radiology is definitely an effective
therapy for our cancer patients. This method is the most effective in terms of cost and efficiency. Nearly 50 percent of cancer patients require radiology
treatment. I know that many regions have difficulties in this area. The number
of radiology units and linear accelerators is still below international
standards.</p><p>Therefore, I would like to ask you
to intensify the work to develop domestic radiology equipment, linear
accelerators and replace the expensive heavy medical and diagnostic equipment
in accordance with the technological cycle as part of the cancer treatment
programme. These measures will definitely help achieve the targets you set in your annual Address.</p><p><b><b>Vladimir </b>Putin</b>:
Thank you.</p><p>First, I would like to congratulate
you on your results. These are your achievements and the achievements of your
employees, and they are inspiring. We should make the most of our best practices,
both in your republic and the rest of Russia.</p><p>As for the specific issues you raised,
the first thing we should do is review the preventive medicine data. The best
way to do this is by addressing another objective first, we talked about this,
digitisation and informatisation, and then it will all fall into place. That is
the programme we intend to invest in. As I have just said, everything can be calculated.
Believe me, we have calculated up to tens of thousands how much it will cost to implement this country-wide. We will deal with that. That was my first point.</p><p>Secondly, a few words about efficient
medicines and techniques. As far as I know, the Healthcare Ministry has an Expert
Council. In general, medicine has become so complicated today – it is not
simply breaking a pill in half and giving one to a patient for a headache and the other for stomach pain relief. </p><p>We have walked around here and seen
things that are directly related to the most complicated areas of science in different disciplines. Your branch is science-intensive, probably, the most
science-intensive branch. Therefore, only specialists can determine what is
effective and what is not. There is the Expert Council. The only thing I could
probably ask the Minister is to include practicing specialists on the Expert
Council.</p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova</b>: Mr President, we established
a special federal centre that does independent expert reviews on all areas of pharmaceutical and clinical economic effectiveness. It has been operating for the last year and a half. Mr Khairullin, we invite you to attend the council at this centre and see for yourself how all this is already working. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Ms Skvortsova, I think it may
not be enough to just invite one colleague. It might be necessary to invite not
only practicing experts from Tatarstan, but maybe from other clinics as well. We
need to see, three or four specialists may well be included.</p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova</b>: All right. Certainly.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Now a few words about
domestic equipment, especially heavy equipment. We know that it is appearing,
that it exists in principle. But it is perfectly obvious that the range of available equipment must be much broader. It takes a long time to develop and produce such equipment. So we are facing this task in principle. </p><p>Let us get it up to date. Of course,
even after our current meeting it is possible, if necessary, to formulate relevant
instructions to the Government as a whole, to the Healthcare Ministry and the Ministry of Industry to be more active in their joint work than they have been so
far. But I completely agree with you that we must have our own, effective,
modern and promising equipment.</p><p>Go ahead, please.</p><p><b>Yury Zhulyov</b>: Mr President, thank you so
much.</p><p>Let me introduce myself. I am co-Chairman
of the National Patients’ Union and President of the National Hemophilia
Society. My name is Yury Zhulyov. </p><p>I am sorry I was so adamant in asking
to be given the floor, but I am the only representative of the patient community
at this table and, of course, I would like to express a number of considerations
and important positions.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: It is a shame but I did not know
we had a patient community.</p><p><b>Yury Zhulyov</b>: I am glad that you know about
it now and in conclusion I would like to mention again one very important
undertaking that we are doing together with our colleagues.</p><p>It would be strange if I did not talk
about the patient-oriented model of healthcare. Incidentally, as a lawyer I would like to say that in the future we should probably pass a law on this
position. </p><p>There are two very important points that
we are concerned about.</p><p>First, this is really a view of the patient
as the centre of the healthcare system, the consistency of rendering aid to a patient,
starting with diagnostics and ending with rehabilitation – you were absolutely
right to speak about rehabilitation problems. This is the gap between institutions,
different types of aid, including the organisation of aid and routing inside a medical institution as such. I think now the Healthcare Ministry is actively and properly promoting the project “Prudent Outpatient Clinic” whereby patients feel
the constant attention of medical workers and understand the step-by-step rendering
of medical care.</p><p>The second part is crucial. You know that
technology is very important, but medicines are equally important. I would like
to point out a humanitarian aspect, that is, the doctor-patient relationship.
It is a central part of healthcare. To me, patient-focused care is not just a phrase or a term, but something that must be complemented with practical
principles.</p><p>One such principle is the doctor-patient
relationship. We must move away from the boss-subordinate principle of relations to dialogue and partnership. This principle involves two very
important things.</p><p>First, the huge funds we invest in healthcare cannot
attain their goal because patients are not fully aware of their role. Patients
must have the necessary information and act as partners in the process of medical treatment. They must know the elements of the proposed treatment and its goals, as well as their role in this process. This will greatly enhance the efficiency of medical assistance.</p><p>Second, the doctor must have the instruments
for preventing conflicts and must have the skills of doctor-patient
communication. We believe that ethical and communication aspects have been
eroded in the current process of medical education.</p><p>We propose that the principles of deontological ethics and doctor-patient communication be added to the mandatory educational standards.
This is extremely important, because this is what we lack now. Once again, this
is not just my personal opinion.</p><p>I promised to conclude my report by telling you
about an important annual event that the Russian Patients Association holds
together with the Healthcare Ministry. It is a very important event, which Ms
Skvortsova has never missed.</p><p>I am referring to the Russian Congress of Patients, which is attended by delegates from the National Medical Chamber and Mr Roshal, the Civic Chamber and the Russian Popular Front. I believe that our
congress is a very good platform for dialogue between the authorities, public
associations, civil society and patients, a platform where we also discuss the difficult issues I have mentioned.</p><p>I would like to say that in my opinion, apart
from what we are discussing today, the enhanced skills of our doctors would
enhance the quality of medical assistance. </p><p>In conclusion, I would like to thank you
because we do feel that the state is giving priority attention to healthcare,
which is a state priority. The proposals you have put forth in your Address are
not just fine words but a matter of life and death for many people. We look
forward to seeing these proposals implemented, because we know that although
much has been done we must keep moving forward to find solutions to very
serious problems.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Thank you for all your work. I agree with you that we should give our attention to these things. And then we
will probably not see any conflicts such as Mr Roshal mentioned. However, we
must not lay all the blame on one of the parties. What we need is modern and efficient doctor-patient communication.</p><p>This is certainly very important, and merely
reading out the Hippocratic Oath is not enough. What we need is systemic work.
We must discuss this with the Healthcare Ministry and probably also with the National Medical Chamber. It is one of the areas where we must work. I remember
Mr Roshal speaking about this when he told me about the idea of a medical
chamber. </p><p><b>Leonid Roshal:</b> Yes, it is very important to introduce conflictology both for doctors and for patients. The National Medical
Chamber is working in this sphere. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> This issue was raised at the very
beginning, when Mr Roshal told me about the idea of creating the National
Medical Chamber – he also spoke about this issue then.</p><p>Please.</p><p><b>Andrei Kaprin: </b>Mr President, </p><p>I am an oncologist, head of the National Medical Research Institute of Radiology, which includes one of Europe’s oldest institutes, the Pyotr Hertzen Institute. And I, of course, want
to thank you for the attention you have been paying to oncology and for the development directions you have given us.</p><p>It was a very interesting decision,
implemented by the Healthcare Ministry led by Ms Skvortsova, to merge several
centres into one. This association has been operating for about five years and includes the oldest institute in central Moscow and at the same time a huge
institute in Obninsk. It is equipped with cutting-edge radiological equipment.</p><p>Naturally, we would not be able to open such a facility as the one in Obninsk in Moscow or build similar ones in the regions. </p><p>The Ministry of Industry and Trade
is helping us build a centre for pre-clinical studies of new radionuclides and a line of targeted medicinal radio compounds, which our nuclear power also
needs. So, we are grateful and we want to take part in such large associations,
which allow us to not spend additional money on expensive equipment.</p><p>For instance, we have the CyberKnife
which costs 500 million rubles, and the Gamma Knife, which costs 300 million
rubles. But they are not so popular that we need them everywhere. So, I want to thank you for such a sensible and careful attitude to cancer treatment and the related
expenses. We are ready to continue developing our own equipment.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> As for Obninsk, the decision to establish such a centre was a well-thought-out one, I mean the capacities you mentioned. Of course, in this
sense, Obninsk has a huge competitive advantage, and you are making full use of it.</p><p>I wish you further success.
Naturally, we will support everything that was done in Obninsk and the idea of such centres.</p><p>Please.</p><p><b>Nikolai Daikhes: </b>Thank you, Mr President. </p><p>I would like to thank and support
our colleagues from the patient community, because there is the issue of providing high-tech medical assistance to people with disabilities, and we are working
on it now.</p><p>My name is Nikolai Daikhes, I am the director of the Federal Centre of Otorhinolaryngology. We appreciate that we
can speak now, for not always do narrow specialists (we do not like this term,
however) have the opportunity to speak alongside oncologists and cardiologists.
</p><p>Last year, we performed Russia’s
first bionic eye implant surgery on a patient who was completely blind. We
reported on that, and you supported us then.</p><p>There are several such first
surgeries in the world, and Russia is in the lead. Naturally, it is very important
that we combine this method with the already known method of cochlear implant
surgery, which provides a sense of sound to people who are profoundly deaf. It
especially concerns children.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Does it have to be performed at a very early age? </p><p><b>Nikolai Daikhes: </b>Preferably.And, of course,
in Russia we have made a breakthrough, I will say a few words about it…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Sometime before the age of three?</p><p><b>Nikolai Daikhes: </b>Before theage of three, so
thatthe child will not become
deaf-mute. But it is helpful to adults too. When we make advances, we must not
deprive them of such an opportunity. I mentioned people with disabilities
because there are millions of people with impaired hearing and sight in Russia,
and these technologies provide us with unique opportunities. The most important
thing is that we can now help deaf-blind people, to whom you also provide
social assistance. You are doing a lot for them, we know it.</p><p>Of course, such opportunities arise here. In general, restoring impaired sensory functions is one of the most important
breakthrough technologies of the 21<sup>st</sup> century medicine. And, of course, the fact that today Russia is a leader in this area – in restoring both
the sight and the hearing – is a reason to rejoice.</p><p>However, we regard the development of the Russian production base for such devices as our important task. We believe that
we need a state programme or maybe your order to promote our cooperation with
the medical industry in creating high-tech methods. Perhaps we need to create a cluster.</p><p>Today we have spoken a lot about establishing
large centres. We opened a centre three years ago. It is the largest centre for otorhinolaryngology and head and neck surgery in Europe and the world. Of course, we cannot compete with academician Yevgeny Shlyakhto, but it looks rather
good all the same. We have branches in Khabarovsk and Astrakhan, where people
receive high-tech treatment in these areas, and they do not have to go to Moscow for this. We believe it is very important for developing federal
centres.</p><p><i>(Then Nikolai Daikhes
spoke about R&amp;D cooperation with the industry.)</i></p><p>As a member of the Russian Civic Chamber, I can
say on behalf of my colleagues, not only doctors but all of them, that the next
Civic Chamber forum (this year we have seven, and you will attend the final
one, where we will present a report) is dedicated to the healthy way of life.
There are two issues related to the patient community and all our public
organisations, because they are also involved in this: oncology and inbound
medical tourism, which we have spoken about today. This is also very important
for us, and we will present this in the final Civic Chamber report at the end
of the year.</p><p>Thank you, Mr President.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I would like to congratulate you on the level you have reached and thank you for the results of your work. Please
pass on my best regards to all your colleagues.</p><p>As for the equipment, yes, we have talked about
it, but we need the Healthcare Ministry together with the corresponding
agencies and the Government, first of all the Industry Ministry, to take care
of this. I will take note of this, and following our meeting, we will issue a corresponding instruction, among other things.</p><p>What is important here? A lot of our
enterprises are basically ready. They have even set such targets, especially defence
industry enterprises that have the necessary equipment and well-trained
personnel.</p><p>You probably saw the second part of my Address
to the Federal Assembly, which was devoted to defence. Why do we have those capabilities?
We have re-equipped defence industry enterprises, investing almost three
trillion rubles in recent years. Otherwise, it would have been impossible to achieve
this, there would have been no equipment, but we have it as well as the personnel.</p><p>What must we ensure? This is the Healthcare
Ministry’s task: the consumer market. The defence industry’s task is to diversify production and gradually reach the level of at least 50 percent civil
production in the near future.</p><p>Some enterprises are already producing 20 to 30
percent, but we must reach at least 50 percent and even more when defence procurement
goes down. Everybody is interested in this. They must have a market, because
sometimes they complain that they are ready to produce this or that equipment,
but nobody buys it because they prefer foreign versions.</p><p><b>Nikolai Daikhes: </b>Mr President, I have noted, and you
heard me, that we need close cooperation. We can tell them what we need, and when we order what the institute needs and they make it, we will buy it
automatically; we will do it for ourselves.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Excellent. You are right. Thank you
very much for raising this issue. Let’s work on this. Everybody is interested
in this, so let us work harder.</p><p><b>Yury
Lobzin:</b>
Mr President,</p><p>I am a doctor treating infectious
diseases, and I cannot help but say a few words about infectious diseases
because we have discussed all issues here, including cancer treatment and cardiovascular diseases. All of them are very important, but we cannot forget
about infectious diseases.</p><p>I head the Children’s Clinical
Research Centre of Infectious Diseases. I would like to thank you very much on behalf of the Centre’s employees and all doctors treating infectious diseases
in children and adults. The Institute of Child Infections was eking out a miserable existence six years ago, with its buildings dating back to 1901–1902.</p><p>You signed the Federal Targeted
Investment Programme. Today, our Centre has turned into a modern European-class
and, maybe, even world-class organisation. Its area has more than tripled from
10,000 to 36,000 square metres. The Centre’s modern expert-class systems
account for 98 percent of its equipment. We provide wonderful opportunities for patients, and we treat children inside individual Meltzer boxes.</p><p>We can say proudly that this is a truly
modern and efficient centre. This is important for the entire country because it
is the only leading centre that trains doctors from other regions. Today, we
have obtained very serious results in etiological decoding and antibiotic
resistance. This task has global, rather than just national, significance.</p><p>I would like to thank Ms Skvortsova
for attending the celebrations of our institute’s 90<sup>th</sup> anniversary
last year. In her report at the World Health Assembly, she even cited research
papers of the centre’s experts. </p><p>Second, we are now saving children
who could not be saved in the past. This year alone, we treated 17 children
with extremely serious cases of meningococcal infection, acute meningitis and encephalitis with severe brain damage, and we saved 15 of them. In the past,
children with acute Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome succumbed to the disease.</p><p>Rehabilitation is the third issue.
This complex has managed to preserve all three aspects, including diagnostics,
intensive therapy and the rehabilitation system. Russian-made equipment
accounts for 60 percent of our up-to-date equipment making it possible to restore children’s locomotor and mental functions within two months, rather
than 12 to 18 months as before. Ms Skvortsova has seen such children, including
a completely paralysed 12-year-old girl from Crimea. She walked away from us
two months later, and she even danced before us in gratitude.</p><p>Mr President, our centre now trains
Russian and foreign doctors, and this is a major achievement. Eighteen months
after renovation, the centre has already trained 400 doctors from other
countries, and this number is quite substantial. Dr Carissa F. Etienne, Director
of the Pan American Health Organisation of the World Health Organisation,
visited us and asked whether she could come here more often. She said she liked
our centre and noted its impressive level. Therefore, we have every reason to feel proud. </p><p>Thank you once again for adopting the programme at that time. They told me that it was easier to shut down our centre
than to renovate it. But it is impossible to shut it down because this is the only leading national centre that charts the strategy for treating children’s
infections.</p><p>There is another painful moment, if
I may. Of course, this is all good, but it would be better if children did not get
infections at all. Unfortunately, 85 percent of all diseases are childhood
illnesses. And children die – about 50 percent of all deaths are also due to infections, and probably 25 to 30 percent of infections result in disability.
In this regard, a painful issue is vaccines for prevention, which also ensure
the security of our country.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Is this prevention effective in the case of infectious diseases?</p><p><b>Yury Lobzin:</b>
Absolutely. Here’s the latest case: a dad came to the patient community – his
daughter was saved from a meningococcal infection – and said: if I knew that it
was possible to prevent this grave illness, when she was between life and death
for two weeks, with a single vaccine, of course, I would have done it and I should have done it. But here there are problems.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
But now some people prefer to avoid vaccination…</p><p><b>Yury Lobzin:</b> Unfortunately, Mr President, there
is an anti-vaccine trend. I do not know who promotes it, where it comes from,
because we have a lot of resistance against vaccinations, so if it was
regulated on a national scale, it would be great.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> In some countries, children are not
admitted to preschools, kindergartens without vaccinations.</p><p><b>Yury Lobzin:</b> Yes.</p><p><b>Yury Zhulev:</b> Mr President, we, as the patient
community, do oppose these trends.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Which trends?</p><p><b>Yury Zhulev:</b> When parents refuse to vaccinate
their children. They endanger the lives of their children.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> They endanger the lives of their
own children and also other children at a school or kindergarten.</p><p><b>Yury Zhulev:</b> Of course, and also other children.
Therefore, our Russian Patients Association is in solidarity with the Healthcare
Ministry, with specialists. Everywhere, where possible, we talk about our
attitude to this process. This is really a matter of security throughout the country and specific children. It is outrageous.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You raised a very important issue.
And to address it, of course, we cannot use more rigid methods, some
administrative orders. We badly need the interaction between specialists and public organisations. And I am very grateful to you for this.</p><p>This, of course, is subject to discussion. Some
administrative decisions may also be adopted. We just need to do this
carefully, without administrative shouting and commands. But we need to explain
it to people what are the potential results of their behaviour, what it can
lead to.</p><p>After all, this is always a very difficult
choice, especially when it comes to children. There are examples where these
vaccinations lead to adverse consequences, so we need to work carefully with
people.</p><p>Thank you for raising the issue.</p><p><b>Yegor Korchagin: </b>Mr President,</p><p>I represent a large regional Siberian healthcare
centre: the regional clinical hospital in Krasnoyarsk. I am the head doctor,
Yegor Korchagin.</p><p>We are very happy that our hospital got lucky
with the upcoming 2019 Universiade and we will build an advanced surgery wing.
This will create entirely new conditions for treating our patients. These
include patients with burns, cardiac diseases and organ transplants.</p><p>To tell the truth, this will bring medical help
in our country to a new level. The hospital is to open on the eve of the Universiade. I am sure that the day when we will open this advanced wing in our
city together with you is not too far off.</p><p>I would like to focus on two issues that have
not been discussed today.</p><p>First, as Mr Roshal said, recently we received
a large number of complaints, including those in the media, for allegedly poor quality
medical help. In addition, there is an opinion that healthcare workers are overworked.
I think there are two aspects to solving this problem: medical and sociopsycological.</p><p>The first one has to do with the fact that
advanced medical technology must be based on clinical recommendations designed
by specialists based on tests that prove the effectiveness of these approaches.
It is clear that many things in medicine depend on experience today and maybe
on the readiness to tackle tasks in an unconventional way.</p><p>I am absolutely certain that before doing
something creative we must implement the mandatory programme, I mean comply
with the procedures adopted by the medical community. The procedure for providing
medical help and treatment protocols in concrete hospitals must be drafted based
on these clinical recommendations.</p><p>We know that Ms Skvortsova’s colleagues have
drafted a document amending federal legislation and approving standard approaches
to developing clinical recommendations, and I would like to ask you to approve
this document in the near future. I think it would benefit the entire medical
community.</p><p>The second aspect of this issue is related to the things the representatives of the Civic Chamber and the patients’ community
have already said. However, I am not only talking about the doctor–patient
problem. There are many people working in healthcare who are not doctors, and just one rude word from a guard or a clerk can destroy all the titanic work
done to save patients.</p><p>I believe that we must promote the so-called
national intellect technology, when personnel understand what the patient needs
and respond correctly. I would like this to be supported, too. We are implementing
this technology, and recently we have seen more and more gratitude from
patients for our help.</p><p>The second topic, which, in my opinion, also needs to be discussed – and it was reflected in your Address – is
about providing medical care to people residing in remote areas. The Krasnoyarsk
Territory is, perhaps, the most vivid example of the difficulties involved in organising high-quality medical care for residents scattered across a territory
of over 3,000 kilometres from north to south.</p><p>Clearly, we can’t build a modern
multi-specialty hospital in every small village. In this regard, it is
critically important to follow certain guidelines for establishing medical institutions
throughout the territories. It is important to make proper arrangements in the regions and cities to make sure patients from small villages are taken to specific hospitals in a timely manner.</p><p>I am glad the ambulance aviation service
was supported. This service has been in existence at the regional clinical
hospital in Krasnoyarsk since 1940. Perhaps, we are among the regions that are
making the most of this service to provide specialised medical care to patients
in the Krasnoyarsk Territory. Last year alone we used this service to save the lives of 3,500 patients, of which 530 were children. It is important. And the patients
are very appreciative.</p><p>Thanks to the project introduced in Russia last year to support ambulance aviation, we were able to use domestic
aircraft with proper patient stability equipment.</p><p>Please keep this project going, and use more light helicopters to transport patients, which will improve our results
and provide fast service.</p><p>Thank you very much for your attention
to our sector, in particular, to regional medicine. I wish you every success.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Thank you very much.</p><p>I will comment on certain points.</p><p>Concerning the quality of medical
care and the issues arising from it that are related to clinical guidelines, as I understand it, the Healthcare
Ministry has drafted these guidelines, and they are being approved by the federal executive bodies.</p><p><i>(Addressing Veronika Skvortsova.)</i> When are you planning to introduce them?</p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova</b>: Mr President, everything has been approved, and the main legal
department produced the final document. It was submitted to the Government and will
soon be reviewed by the drafting committee.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
So, it will be submitted to the Duma and become federal law. So, things are moving
in a rather specific and proper manner.</p><p>You are right, clinical guidelines alone
will not do, although they are critically important. Perhaps, they are the key to everything, at least, there will be benchmarks which can be used during performance
reviews of medical institutions and specific doctors.</p><p>However, you mentioned that there are
also technical personnel in addition to doctors and medical staff, and everything matters here, the actions of each person matters. What can I say?
This is part of our general culture.</p><p>Here, the importance of culture in the broad sense of the word is so great that it cannot be overestimated. So, in addition to education, healthcare and infrastructure, we should not forget
about culture, or we will fail in any industry. Of course, we must work on this,
in specific industries, and your most important industry, in particular.</p><p>Now about easy access to medical care.
I have really spoken about this, I believe this to be very important, and we
are talking about this for the third time today. We must develop paramedic
centres as well as mobile medical stations.</p><p>These are accounting items, I repeat, they are counted; we will work on it persistently. Now I am not speaking
about concrete numbers in children’s healthcare. We have started allocating an additional 10 billion, and we will work this way. Now I am speaking without
numbers, but we will work on these areas.</p><p>As for aviation, it is clear that
our enormous country – you spoke about the Krasnoyarsk Territory, and it is
very huge, like an entire state – so we cannot do without aviation. In general,
the distribution of health facilities in the region is, first of all, up to the region; the region, governors and deputies of the legislative assemblies are
responsible for it. We help and we will help, let us say, with the development
of ambulance and medical aviation. The only important thing is for it to be
used effectively.</p><p>I have visited a region recently.
There is a helicopter, which was bought long ago, and nobody uses it. Why did
they spend the money? Everything can be explained: petroleum is expensive, or kerosene, or maybe the personnel is not ready. They should not have bought it
then; they only wasted money on it.</p><p>This is why we will do everything
for development, we cannot do without it in Russia, but the things we have work
quite effectively. But healthcare organisers in the regions as well as the medical community must carefully monitor these things.</p><p>I think that is all. Thank you very
much.</p><p>Did anyone want to say something?
Please.</p><p><b>Dmitry Ivanov: </b>Mr President,</p><p>I head the Paediatric Medical
University, and, in addition, I am the head neonatologist in the Healthcare
Ministry. My name is Dmitry Ivanov.</p><p>I would like to say that the construction of perinatal centres and, to tell the truth, the unprecedented
attention from the state, the Ministry and you personally to the infant and child mortality rate yield results. We have enormous potential to decrease infant
mortality even more.</p><p>In addition, my colleagues have
already said a lot, but I think that probably if there were target indicators
to lower the mortality rate, this would also have results. I think we have great
resources here.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I think we have set these goals.</p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova: </b>We have, and the child mortality rate has decreased 30 percent in five
years. Last year it was equal for villages and cities alike for the first time;
this has never happened before. So, there is progress, but Dmitry Ivanov is
right, we have a lot to achieve and we have additional resources. We will
continue to lower it.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>He is talking about including it as an objective, am I right?</p><p><b>Dmitry Ivanov: </b>Yes. Further decrease.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>It is true, and this is how we will do it. I completely agree with you. This is a key area in medicine in general and children’s medicine in particular. Of course… This is why we have constructed
perinatal centres and this is why we will develop all children’s medicine. This
is why we allocate additional resources: 10 billion per year. We will see to it.</p><p><b>Alexandra Budova: </b>Good afternoon, Mr President.</p> <p>My name is Alexandra Budova, and I am the head physician at the Murmansk Regional Clinical Hospital.</p> <p>I would like to join the words of gratitude from my colleagues. I know problems in our medicine from the inside.
I was born into a family of doctors and have been in this profession for almost
28 years, first as a nurse's aide. I remember very well how, in the late 90s,
brilliant green antiseptic and gauze bandages were brought into hospitals, and today we are already discussing proton therapy and how quickly our modern
high-tech complexes are created. </p> <p>But what do I want to say? Medicine and healthcare can never be isolated, or in other words, it is an area that
interacts with others very closely. So today I would like to express words of gratitude for what I heard in the Presidential Address to the Federal Assembly,
that the government pays very serious attention to reforming and developing the education system. </p> <p>I saw what they do at the Sirius centre. I see
how the Agency for Strategic Initiatives has worked out a system for finding
talents, how we have learnt to work with these children and human resources. This is very important
because our future depends on our present. </p> <p>I want to express separate thanks for the reincarnation and government support of the mentorship system. You know, it was
always accepted in medicine from time immemorial, yet, nonetheless, it has
somehow eroded. At present, this very important thing is being revived. There
is no medical university in our region, but we engage medical college students
in our project activities. </p> <p>Our hospital has created a special project:
eight topics for female college students. You know, such a fresh,
non-traditional and offbeat vision of some problems that we are no longer able
to solve ourselves has appeared.</p> <p>Next week will see the final stage of this
contest and I realise: what began with a formal message to revive mentorship has
grown into such a proper, vivid project. So, thank you very much. You know,
Russia is a country of talents.</p> <p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Thank you.</p> <p>In conclusion, I would like to thank you again
for this meeting. I want to say that it has practical meaning and practical
sense, because much of what we heard today, my colleagues from the Government
and I, we will certainly summarise this, put this into corresponding documents
and instructions and, while working on, preparing corresponding executive
orders, including in the healthcare sector, I will certainly try to take into
account everything that we discussed today. </p> <p>I want to say again to all of you thank you
very much for the results of your work, and I want to wish you every success in your so very important, so very necessary and still more and more interesting
profession. Indeed, today I toured the centre, where we are now: it has
fantastic things that were impossible to even dream of yesterday, to even think
that this could be possible. Today, all this is being done, being done in our
country, being done so interestingly, with such enthusiasm and by people, who
are so passionate about their cause.</p> <p>All the best to you. Thank you so much.</p>    <div class="read__cut read__cut_full_size masha-ignore" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="40353-cut"> <div class="cut"> <h3 class="cut__title" id="40353-cut">See also</h3>   <div class="cut__description">  <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/acts/news/57079" class="cut__item cut__link" target="_blank">Executive Order On Bestowing the Badge of Merit For Mentorship</a> <div class="cut__date">March 16, 2018</div>  </div>  </div> </div> <div class="read__bottommeta hidden-copy"> <div class="width_limiter">   <div class="read__tags masha-ignore">  <div class="read__tagscol"> <h3>Geography</h3> <ul class="read__taglist"><li><a
