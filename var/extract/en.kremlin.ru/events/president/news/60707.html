The discussion is
moderated by journalist, RT TV Channel presenter Sophie Shevardnadze. </p><p>* * *</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze </b><i>(retranslated)</i>: Hello, everyone,</p><p>I am Sophie Shevardnadze. I am very
glad to be able to moderate today’s plenary session, because the St Petersburg
Forum is a unique platform that brings together businessmen, officials and leaders whose paths would never otherwise have crossed, anywhere in the world.
We meet each year to figure out how to move the world forward.</p><p>I had the opportunity to talk with
our speakers shortly before the start. I think they are committed to having a candid conversation. In any case, I very much hope that we will have one today.</p><p> And now, the traditional speeches by heads of state. Mr President, you are first.</p><p><b>President of Russia Vladimir Putin:</b> Good afternoon, friends and colleagues, ladies
and gentlemen. </p><p>I am happy to welcome to Russia all
heads of state and government, all participants in the St Petersburg
International Economic Forum. We are grateful to our guests for their attention
and friendly attitude to Russia and their willingness for joint work and business
cooperation that always rests, as business leaders know well, on pragmatism,
understanding of mutual interests and, of course, trust in each other,
frankness and clear-cut positions.</p><p>I would like to take advantage of the SPIEF venue to tell you not only about the goals and tasks that we in Russia have
set for ourselves but also about our views on the state of the global economic
system. For us this is not an abstract conversation, nor an academic
discussion. Russia’s development, simply by virtue of its size, history,
culture, the human potential and economic opportunities cannot take place
outside the global context, without the correlation of the domestic, national
and global agendas.</p><p>So, what is the state of affairs
today or at least how do we in Russia see it?</p><p>Technically, global economic growth,
and I hope we will mostly talk about that since this is an economic forum, has
been positive in the recent period. In 2011–2017, the global economy grew by an annual average of 2.8 percent. In recent years, the relevant figure was a bit
over three percent. However, we believe, and countries’ leaders and all of us
must frankly admit that regrettably, despite this growth, the existing model of economic relations is still in crisis and this crisis is of a comprehensive nature.
Problems in this respect have been piling up throughout the past few decades.
They are more serious and larger than it seemed before.</p><p>The architecture of the global
economy has changed dramatically since the Cold War as new markets were
becoming part of the globalisation process. The dominant model of development
based on the Western “liberal” tradition, let us call it Euro-Atlantic for the sake of argument, began to claim not just a global, but also a universal role.</p><p>International trade was the main
driver behind the current globalisation model. From 1991 to 2007, it grew more
than twice as fast as global GDP. This can be accounted for by the newly opened
markets of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and goods pouring into
these markets. However, this period turned out to be relatively short-lived by historical standards.</p><p>The global crisis of 2008–2009 ensued.
It not only exacerbated and revealed imbalances and disproportions, but also
showed that global growth mechanisms were beginning to fail. Of course, the international
community learned its lesson. However, truth be told, there was not enough will
or, perhaps, courage, to sort things out and draw the corresponding
conclusions. A simplified approach prevailed whereby the global development
model was allegedly quite good and, essentially, nothing needed to be changed since
it was enough to eliminate the symptoms and coordinate some rules and institutions in the global economy and finance, and then everything would turn
out just fine. There were many hopes and positive expectations back then, but
they quickly vanished. Quantitative easing and other measures failed to resolve
the problems and only pushed them into the future. I am aware that quantitative
easing was discussed at this and other forums. We at the Government and the Presidential Executive Office never stop discussing and debating these matters.</p><p>I will now cite data from the World
Bank and the IMF. Before the crisis of 2008–2009, the global trade in goods and services to global GDP ratio was constantly growing, but then the trend reversed.
It is a fact, there is no such growth anymore. The global trade to global GDP ratio
of 2008 has never been recovered. In fact, global trade ceased to be the unconditional driver behind the global economy. The new engine represented by state-of-the-art technology is still being fine-tuned and not operating at full
capacity. Moreover, the global economy has entered a period of trade wars and mounting
direct or covert protectionism.</p><p>What are the sources of the crisis in international economic relations?
What undermines trust between the world economic players? I think the main reason is that the model of globalisation offered in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century is increasingly at odds with the rapidly emerging new economic reality.</p><p>In the past three decades, the share
of advanced countries in the global GDP in purchasing power parity decreased
from 58 to 40 percent. In the G7 it dropped from 46 to 30 percent, whereas the weight of the countries with developing markets is growing. Such rapid
development of new economies that, apart from their interests, have their own
development platforms and views on globalisation and regional integration
processes does not correlate well with the ideas that seemed immutable
relatively recently. </p><p>The previous patterns essentially
put the Western countries into an exclusive position and we should be straight
about this. These patterns gave them an advantage and an enormous rent, thereby
predetermining their leadership. Other countries simply had to follow in their wake.
Of course, much happened and is still happening to the accompaniment of talk
about equality. I will speak about this as well. And when this comfortable, familiar
system began to grow rickety and competition grew, ambitions and a striving to preserve one’s domination at all costs surged. Under the circumstances, the states
that previously preached the principles of free trade and honest and open competition
began to talk in terms of trade wars and sanctions, and resorted to undisguised
economic raids with arms twisting, intimidation and the removal of rivals by so-called non-market methods.</p><p>Look, there are many examples of this.
I will only mention those that concern us directly and that are common
knowledge. Take, for example, the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas
pipeline. I saw in the hall our partners who work with it professionally, not
only Russians but also our friends from Europe. This project is designed to enhance energy security in Europe and create new jobs. It fully meets the national interests of all participants, both European and Russian. If it did not
meet these interests, we would have never seen our European partners in it. Who
could force them into this project? They came because they were interested in it.</p><p>But this does not match the logic and interests of those who became used to exclusiveness and anything-goes behavior
in the framework of the existing universalist model. They are used to letting others
pay their bills; therefore, endless attempts to torpedo this project are made.
It is alarming that this destructive practice has not only affected traditional
energy, raw materials and commodity markets but it has also leaked into new
industries that are now taking shape. Take the situation with Huawei. Attempts are
being made not just to challenge it on the global market but to actually restrict
it in an off-handed manner. Some circles already call this “the first
technological war” to break out in the digital era.</p><p>It would appear that rapid digital
transformation and technologies that are quickly changing industries, markets
and professions, are designed to expand the horizons for anyone who is willing
and open to change. Unfortunately, here too barriers are being built and direct
bans on high-tech asset purchases are being imposed. It has come to the point where
even the number of foreign students for certain specialties is limited. Frankly,
I find it hard to wrap my mind around this fact. Nevertheless, this is all
happening in reality. Surprising, but true.</p><p>Monopoly is invariably about
concentrating revenue in the hands of a few at the expense of everyone else. In this sense, attempts to monopolise an innovation-driven technology wave and to limit access to its fruits take the problems of global inequality between
countries and regions and within states to a whole new level. This, as we all
know, is the main source of instability. It is not just about the level of income or financial inequality, but fundamental differences in opportunities
for people.</p><p>In essence, an attempt is being made
to build two worlds, the gap between which is constantly widening. In this
situation, certain people have access to the most advanced systems of education
and healthcare and modern technology, while others have few prospects or even chances
to break out of poverty, with some people balancing on the verge of survival.</p><p>Today, more than 800 million people around
the world do not have basic access to drinking water, and about 11 percent of the world's population is undernourished. A system based on ever-increasing
injustice will never be stable or balanced.</p><p>Exacerbating environmental and climatic challenges that represent a direct threat to the socioeconomic well-being
of all humankind are making the crisis even worse. Climate and the environment
have become an objective factor in global development and a problem fraught
with large-scale shocks, including another uncontrolled surge in migration, more
instability and undermined security in key regions of the planet. At the same
time, there is a high risk that instead of joint efforts to address
environmental and climate issues, we will run into attempts to use this issue
for unfair competition.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Today we are facing two extremes, two
possible scenarios for further development. The first is the degeneration of the universalist globalisation model and its turning into a parody, a caricature of itself, where common international rules are replaced with the laws, administrative and judicial mechanisms of one country or a group of influential states. I state with regret that this is what the US is doing today
when it extends its jurisdiction to the entire world. Incidentally, I spoke about
this 12 years ago. Such a model not only contradicts the logic of normal
interstate communication and the shaping realities of a complicated multipolar
world but, most importantly, it does not meet the goals of the future.</p><p>The second scenario is a fragmentation
of the global economic space by a policy of completely unlimited economic
egoism and a forced breakdown. But this is the road to endless conflict, trade
wars and maybe not just trade wars. Figuratively, this is the road to the ultimate
fight of all against all.</p><p>So what is the solution? I am
referring to a real solution rather than utopian or ephemeral one. Obviously, new
agreements will be needed for drafting a more stable and fair development model.
These agreements should not only be written clearly but should also be observed
by all participants. However, I am convinced that talk about an economic world order
like this will remain wishful thinking unless we return to the centre of the discussion,
that is, notions like sovereignty, the unconditional right of every country to its
own development road and, let me add, responsibility for universal sustainable
development, not just for one’s own development.</p><p>What should be the subject of discussion in terms of regulating such agreements and such a common legal environment?
Certainly not the imposition of a single and the only correct canon for all
countries, but above all, the harmonisation of national economic interests,
principles of teamwork, competition and cooperation between countries with
their own individual development models, peculiarities and interests. The drafting
of such principles should be carried out with maximum openness and in the most
democratic manner.</p><p>It is on this foundation that the system
of world trade should be adapted to current realities and the efficiency of the World Trade Organisation enhanced. Other international institutions should be
filled with new meaning and content rather than broken. It is necessary to sincerely
consider, rather than just talk about the requirements and interests of the developing nations, including those that are upgrading their industry,
agriculture and social services. This is what equal conditions for development is
all about.</p><p>Incidentally, we suggest considering
the creation of an open, accessible data bank with the best practices and development projects. Russia is ready to publish its successful case studies in the social, demographic and economic areas on an information platform, and invites other countries and international organisations to join this
initiative.</p><p>With regard to finance, the main
global institutions were created as part of the Bretton Woods system 75 years
ago. The Jamaican currency system that replaced it in the 1970s confirmed the preference of the US dollar but,
in fact, failed to resolve the key problems, primarily, the balance of currency
relations and trade exchanges. New economic centres have appeared since then,
the role of regional currencies has increased, and the balance of forces and interests has changed. Clearly, in the wake of these profound changes,
international financial organisations need to adapt and reconsider the role of the dollar, which, as a global reserve currency, has now become an instrument
of pressure exerted by the issuing country on the rest of the world.</p><p>Incidentally, I believe the US
financial authorities and political centres are making a big mistake as they
are undermining their own competitive edge that appeared after the creation of the Bretton Woods system. Confidence in the dollar is simply plummeting.</p><p>The technological development agenda
must unite countries and people, not divide them. For this, we need fair parameters
for interaction in key areas such as high-tech services, education, technology
transfer, innovative digital economy branches and the global information space.
Yes, building such a harmonious system is certainly challenging, but this is
the best recipe for restoring mutual trust, as we have no alternative.</p><p>We need to join our efforts, being
fully cognizant of the scale of the new era’s global challenges and our
responsibility for the future. To do so, we need to use the potential of the UN,
which is a unique organisation in terms of representation. We should strengthen
its economic institutions and use new associations like the Group of 20 more
effectively. Pending the creation of a set of rules like this, we need to act
in accordance with the current situation and actual problems and have a realistic
understanding of what is happening in the world.</p><p>As a first step, we propose, speaking
diplomatically, to conduct a kind of demilitarisation of the key areas of the global economy and trade, namely, to make the distribution of essential items
such as medicines and medical equipment immune to trade and sanctions wars. (<i>Applause</i>.) Thank you very much for your
understanding. That also includes utilities and energy, which help reduce the impact
on the environment and climate. This, as you understand, concerns areas that
are crucial for the life and health of millions, one might even say, billions
of people, our entire planet.</p><p>Colleagues, </p><p>The current global trends show that
a country’s role, its sovereignty and place in the modern system of reference are
determined by several key factors. They are undoubtedly the ability to ensure
the safety of its citizens, to preserve its national identity and also to contribute
to the progress of world culture. And there are at least three more factors
that, in our opinion, are of key significance. Let me expand on that.</p><p>The first factor is a person’s
wellbeing and prosperity, opportunities to discover their talents.</p><p>The second factor is the society’s
and state’s receptiveness to sweeping technological change. </p><p>And the third factor is freedom of entrepreneurial initiative. Let me start with the first item.</p><p>Russia’s GDP per capita at purchasing
power parity is about $30,000. South and Eastern European countries are at the same level today. Our priority for the coming years is not only to become one
of the world’s top five economies. It is ultimately not a goal in itself but a vehicle; we have to reach and stay at the average European level in all major
parameters reflecting the quality of life and people’s wellbeing. Given this,
we have identified national goals on the growth of the economy and people’s
incomes, decreasing poverty, increasing life expectancy, improving education
and healthcare, and preserving the environment. The national projects we are
implementing are designed to address these tasks.</p><p>The second field is accelerated
technological development. It offers truly colossal opportunities. Our priority
is to be among the front-runners, those who use these technologies and convert
them into a real breakthrough. Thus, according to experts, the introduction of artificial intelligence will add 1.2 percent annual growth to the global GDP.
It is twice as much as the impact from the global IT growth in the early 21<sup>st</sup>
century. The world market of goods with AI will increase almost 17-fold by 2024
to total around half a trillion dollars.</p><p>Just like
other leading nations, Russia has drafted a national strategy for developing AI
technologies. It was designed by the Government along with domestic hi-tech
companies. An executive order launching this strategy will be signed shortly. A detailed, step-by-step road map is incorporated in the Digital Economy national
programme. </p><p>Russia has capable research potential,
and a good starting point for designing the most advanced technological
solutions. And this refers not only to AI, but also to other groups of the so
called end-to-end technologies. In this connection, I propose to our state companies
and the leading Russian private companies to partner with the state in promoting end-to-end research and technologies. These include, as I said,
artificial intelligence and other digital technologies. These are, of course,
new materials, genome technologies for medicine, agriculture and industry, as well as portable sources of energy, technologies for energy transfer and storage.</p><p>The practical results of such a partnership should be the production and promotion
of successful breakthrough products and services both in the domestic and foreign markets. This is an opportunity for the state to build its powerful
sovereign potential, and for companies – a chance to enter a new technological
era. We
discussed all these issues at a special meeting in Moscow just a week ago.
Following the meeting, respective agreements will be signed shortly with Sberbank, Rostec,
Rosatom, Russian Railways and Rostelecom. A package of corresponding documents
has already been prepared. I ask our leading fuel and energy companies –
Gazprom, Rosneft, Rosseti, Transneft – to join this work, this large-scale
project. I give the Government a directive to manage this effort.</p><p>How will the state and large companies cooperate? Under the partnership
agreement, the companies
invest in research and development, they invest in competence centres, start-up support, training personnel
in research, management and engineering and in attracting foreign specialists. The state, in turn,
will provide financial and tax incentives, generate demand for domestic
hi-tech products, including through government procurement, that is, it will guarantee
a market. We will keep working on this. Our Chinese friends may also buy a bit more of our new products. </p><p>We need to fine-tune the system of technical standards, and even introduce
a sort of experimental legal framework. An adequate and flexible legal environment is
a key issue for new industries, and establishing it around the world brings new problems; there are many
sensitive issues both for state security and for the interests of society and its people. But in order to achieve
results, it is critically important to speed up the decision-making process, so
I ask our colleagues from the Government, experts, and the business community
to offer an effective mechanism for this.</p><p>New
industries will require specialists with new skills. We are moving quickly to upgrade programmes and education content for this. As you may know, in August,
Kazan will host the WorldSkills Championships, during which, at Russia’s initiative,
the first ever competition in the competences of the future will take place,
including machine learning and big data, composite materials technology and quantum technologies. I wish every success to our team and the participants in the competition. </p><p>I would like
to mention that we have created a new platform, <i>Russia – An Ocean of Opportunity</i>, to encourage personal and professional growth. It holds competitions, in which schoolchildren, young
people and people of different ages from Russia and abroad can take part. A human resources project like this is unprecedented in scale. It drew over 1.6 million
people in 2018 and 2019 alone. We are committed to promoting this system, to making
it more effective and transparent, because the more daring and talented people engage
in business, science and public and social administration, the greater success
we will achieve in handling development issues and the more globally competitive
our country will be. </p><p>The third
factor in the country’s competitiveness, which was mentioned earlier, is a favourable
business environment. We are working on this consistently and will continue to work on it. Today, if we look at a number of services for businesses and the quality
of the most in-demand administrative procedures, we are similar to, and in some
cases even outperform, countries with strong and deep-rooted traditions of entrepreneurship.
</p><p>Healthy competition between regions to attract entrepreneurs,
investment and projects has been gaining momentum. The efficiency of management
teams has increased a lot. A serious incentive for this change was the development of the National Investment Climate Rankings for the constituent regions
of the Russian Federation.
In keeping with an established tradition at the St Petersburg International
Economic Forum, I would like to announce and congratulate the winners of the 2019 National Rankings. They are Moscow, Tatarstan, Tyumen and Kaluga regions
and St Petersburg. <i>(Applause.)</i> I also
applaud them.</p><p>As for the pace at which the investment climate is improving, the leaders are Yakutia, Primorye
Territory, Samara Region, Crimea and North Ossetia, Perm Territory, Nizhny
Novgorod Region, Udmurtia and Ivanovo and Novgorod regions. I would like to take
this opportunity to ask the heads of the regions and the presidential envoys to these federal districts to step up their work to attract private capital to the national programmes and our other development projects, including through the Russian Direct Investment Fund and other modern and effective mechanisms. </p><p>As I mentioned, there are some positive
changes in the business climate, notably, administrative procedures, but there
are still urgent problems that worry business. First, we still have to deal
with the archaic nature and obvious excesses of the oversight bodies, as well
as the unjustified and sometimes simply illegal interference of law enforcement
in the business environment, in the operation of companies.</p><p>This year we launched a deep and comprehensive reform of monitoring and oversight. It is the largest reform in the post-Soviet era. Starting January 1, 2021 the entire old, largely obsolete legal
framework will cease to operate. It will be replaced by a clear-cut system of requirements:
any duplication of government body authority should be eliminated, grounds for random inspections or audits restricted and a risk-based approach established.</p><p>The information service that is to be launched this year will make it possible to objectively compare information
from oversight bodies on the one hand and entrepreneurs on the other. Any incongruities
must result in a timely response.</p><p>As regards the relationship between
business and law enforcement, the logic of our actions includes the further liberalisation
of legislation, the strengthening of the guarantees and rights of ownership,
the removal of even formal opportunities for abusing the law to exert pressure
on business, and the constant cleansing of authority agencies and the judicial
system of unscrupulous personnel. More transparency in the business environment
is a major condition for the effectiveness of this work. This is also very
important, colleagues. This year there will be a digital platform, a kind of a digital ombudsman that entrepreneurs will be able to use to report any illegal
actions by representatives of law-enforcement agencies. I think such openness
can become a guarantee of trust between the public, business and the state. </p><p>Overall, we must ensure the transformation
of the government management system based on digital technology as soon as possible. The goal is to comprehensively upgrade the effectiveness of the performance
of all government bodies, reduce the speed and improve the quality of decision-making. I would like to ask the Government to present a specific plan
of action in this regard in cooperation with the regional governors. We have spoken
about this many times.</p><p>Colleagues, Russia has repeatedly carried
out large-scale projects of spatial development in its history. They have become
symbols of deep and dynamic change in the country, in its forward progress.
Such comprehensive projects are being implemented now in the South of Russia,
the Far East and in the Arctic. Today we must think about the upsurge of the vast
territories of central and eastern Siberia. We must draft, accurately calculate
and coordinate a development plan. This macro region contains very rich natural
resources, about a quarter of all forest reserves, over half of the coal
reserves, substantial deposits of copper and nickel, and tremendous energy
reserves, many of which have already been developed. </p><p>In addition, there are unique
opportunities for agricultural development. There are over 300 sunny days in the Minusinsk Hollow area. This
makes it possible to establish a new powerful agro-industrial complex there as well. Russian and foreign experts believe that up to several trillion rubles of investment can be attracted to this macro region, up to 3 trillion, provided,
of course, that the government also invests in the development of infrastructure, the social sphere and housing. The development of areas in central
and eastern Siberia, not as a raw materials base, but as a scientific and industrial centre should turn this region into a link between the European part
of Russia and the Far East, between the markets of China, the Asia Pacific
Region and Europe, including Eastern Europe, and attract a fresh, well-trained
workforce. </p><p>I would like to ask the Government to draft the necessary programmes in cooperation with the expert community and the Russian Academy of Sciences and to report back to me in autumn. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends,</p><p>Today in Russia, we have embarked on implementing truly strategic long-term programmes, many of which are global in nature,
without exaggeration. The speed and scale of today’s changes in the world are unprecedented
in history, and in the coming era, it is important for us to hear each other
and pool our efforts for resolving common goals. </p><p>Friends, </p><p> Russia is ready for these challenges and changes.
We invite all of you to take part in this large-scale and equitable
cooperation. I am grateful for your attention. Thank you.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Thank you, Mr President. You have identified very important issues,
including the fact that the existing rules do not suit anyone in today's world.
We will consider this at length during our discussions.</p><p>President Xi, your turn, please go
ahead.</p><p><b>President of the People’s Republic of China Xi Jinping</b> <i>(retranslated)</i><b>:</b> President Putin, colleagues, guests,
ladies and gentlemen, friends,</p><p>I am very pleased to attend the St
Petersburg International Economic Forum at the invitation of President Putin. I want to sincerely thank President Putin and our Russian friends for the warm
welcome and hospitality.</p><p>St Petersburg is Russia’s sea
capital and the internationally renowned crown jewel of the Baltic Sea. Thanks
to three centuries of tradition and its rapid development, the city radiates
the charm of classicism and the elegance of modernity. We have a lot of admiration
for this.</p><p>Yesterday after lunch, President
Putin and I had a boat trip along the Neva River. I was delighted by the interesting
story he told me about the history and the culture of your country and this
city.</p><p>“The city on the free Neva, the city
of our labour glory…” the song that President Putin once played on the piano clearly
demonstrates the special place that St Petersburg has in the heart of the Russian people.</p><p>Since its foundation in 1997, the St
Petersburg International Economic Forum has never stopped expanding and strengthening and has become a unique platform for extensive discussions in the name of cooperation.</p><p>This year, the St Petersburg Forum
is being held under the following banner: we are setting the agenda for sustainable development which meets the general concerns of the international
community and is of great importance.</p><p>The modern world is undergoing
profound change, unparalleled in centuries. The growth rates in emerging and developing economies are unprecedentedly high.</p><p>The unprecedented growth rates and the intense competition are unfolding amid a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. The global governance
systems and processes have become disproportionate and dysfunctional as never
before.</p><p>In a changing world, joint efforts
and mutually beneficial cooperation is the correct path to follow for all
countries without exception.</p><p>Globally, sustainable development
is, perhaps, the best common denominator of global cooperation. The UN agenda
for sustainable development to 2030, in the spirit of harmonious coexistence between
people and nature, which takes into account the needs of the current and future
generations, provides a new vision for global development. It focuses on three
main interrelated areas: economic growth, social development and the environment.</p><p>This year marks the 70<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of the People’s Republic of China. As the world's largest
developing economy and a responsible global power, China is firmly adhering to its commitments in sustainable development and has won widespread recognition
and respect for its successes.</p><p>China attaches particular importance
to promoting international cooperation in sustainable development. This is
corroborated by the Belt and Road initiative that I launched in 2013, which is
designed to provide mutual benefits and universal development. This initiative
is largely consonant with the UN agenda in the area of sustainable development
to 2030 in terms of goals, principles and methodologies, and enjoys the support
of the international community.</p><p>The Second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was held successfully in Beijing in April. The participants agreed on the high-quality implementation of the Belt and Road
initiative based on the principle of joint discussion, joint implementation and shared use. According to the concept of openness, environmental friendliness
and integrity, cooperation will be carried out with high quality and for the benefit of the people and sustainable development. </p><p>As we form the global network of interconnectedness and partnership, we will effectively couple the Belt and Road
initiative with the sustainable development agenda, ensure harmony between the economy, society and the environment in the interest of green, low-carbon and sustainable development.</p><p>Of course, we cannot do without
sincere, trustworthy and likeminded partners in international cooperation.
Russia is not only our largest neighbour and a comprehensive strategic partner,
but also one of the most important and most prioritised partners in all areas
of cooperation.</p><p>In the spirit of sustainable
development, our countries are actively cooperating in renewable energy, and consider
scientific and technical innovation, the digital economy and electronic
commerce as drivers in new cooperation. They also enjoy fruitful cooperation in the protection of cross-border resources and in managing cross-border nature
reserves.</p><p>Mr Putin and I agreed on certain
aspects of integration in the Belt and Road initiative and the EAEU. At the same time, the initiative to jointly implement the Belt and Road project is compliant
with Mr Putin’s idea of a major Eurasia-wide partnership. They can complement
each other, which, in my opinion, will boost regional economic integration in the interests of common sustainable development.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends,</p><p>Sustainable development is not just a natural but also the inevitable result of the development of production capacity
and technological progress.</p><p>Most of the world’s countries strive
to achieve this. As people say, where there is a will, there is a way. It is
impossible to stop people from striving for a better life. We are ready,
together with all of our partners, to turn statements into practical steps and to jointly turn a new page in sustainable development.</p><p>First, it is important, through
joint efforts, to form an open and diversified global economy in the spirit of joint implementation and common use. China will gradually expand its openness,
in particular, access to our market, and create a favourable business
environment for fair competition. We will promote economic globalisation, as well as a multilateral trade system, and will make efforts to overcome irregularity
and inequality in the development of the global economy.</p><p>We are determined to create mutually
beneficial trade cooperation based on equality and mutual trust. We will strive
to achieve synergy between the Belt and Road initiative and the UN agenda on sustainable development until 2030, as well as reveal the potential of the South-South Cooperation Assistance Fund, and the UN-China Peace and Development
Fund, and to provide more opportunities for the developing countries. China is
ready to share with all our partners its technological development and experience,
in particular 5G technology, as well as to create additional key advantages and change the model of economic growth.</p><p>My second point is that we need to step up efforts to build a tolerant society of universal prosperity that puts
the interests of a common person at the forefront. Improving people’s wellbeing
is the top priority of any state. China is continuing to work hard to eliminate
poverty this year to completely move the rural population out of poverty by 2020. More than 11 million new jobs will have been created by the end of this
year. Enormous efforts go into vocational training, volunteering and charity,
as well as protecting the rights and interests of socially vulnerable groups.</p><p>We are willing to step up
cooperation and exchange experience with all our partners in cutting poverty
and improving social security so that the peoples in different countries live
in prosperity and feel happy and protected.</p><p>My third point is that we need to adhere to the course of green development in the name of building a beautiful
home where people and nature live in harmony. As the famous Russian writer
Dostoevsky said, beauty will save the world. Preserving the beauty of nature
for our grandchildren and great-grandchildren is the glorious mission of our
generation.</p><p>China is by no means pursuing
development at the expense of the environment. For us, green mountains and emerald waters are untold treasures for the sake of which we will conduct an uncompromising struggle, including the development of green industry, renewable
energy sources, resource-saving technologies and circular economy.</p><p>In international cooperation, we
will focus more on the environment and environmental activities. We are willing
to jointly address current challenges in global climate change and biodiversity
conservation, in particular, by way of proper implementation of the Paris
Agreement.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, friends,</p><p>Peace and development remain the top
priorities of our time. The fates of different nations are now closely
interrelated as never before. The interests of all countries are
unprecedentedly integrated, and the trend towards peace, development,
cooperation and a win-win approach is irreversible.</p><p>At the same time, new problems and challenges are arising amid increasing anti-globalisation, hegemonism and power-based
politics. Once again, humanity is at a crossroads. Sustainable development as the best way out of the current situation overlaps with the initiative to form humanity’s
single destiny community in terms of goals and values. They will serve as the common
good for all of humankind and the world in general.</p><p>In conjunction with all other countries
and guided by the sustainable development concept, China will work for the benefit
of the common future of humankind, advance multilateralism, improve global governance
systems, promote sustainable peace on the planet and open a bright and prosperous future hand in hand with other nations.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> Thank you, President Xi.</p><p>President Radev, please.</p><p><b>President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev </b><i>(retranslated)</i><b>:</b> Ms Shevardnadze,
Messieurs Presidents and Prime Ministers, Mr UN Secretary-General, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>First of all, I would like to thank
the organisers, primarily President Putin for his invitation and this opportunity
to take part in this prestigious forum. It is a great honour for me to be next
to President Xi Jinping. I am happy that as a committed advocate of multilateral diplomacy I will be able to discuss issues of sustainable
development with UN Secretary-General Guterres and with the prime ministers of Slovakia and Armenia.</p><p>The St Petersburg forum has asserted
itself as a venue for meetings on large economies with big politics, a platform
for discussing key issues of global development today. The participation of the President of a 7-million strong Bulgaria, the prime ministers of Slovakia and Armenia next to the two global leaders is a very powerful message about the importance of one of the strongest ideas in sustainable development, notably,
that this kind of development is made possible only through the contribution of all states.</p><p>For me, participation is an indication of the recognition of Bulgaria’s ability to build bridges between
different regions and cultures. </p><p>In the new millennium, sustainable
development has moved to the top of the international agenda. In our time, some
countries took advantage of globalisation whereas others lost. Our planet is
being stifled by the super-exploitation of its riches and enormous trade
traffic.</p><p>We are seeing an increase in population and a decrease in resources. In the digital era, free movement of capital without clear-cut rules generates risks for the most vulnerable
societies, while overconsumption, which has turned into a symbol of personal
economic success, has already become a threat to our common future. </p><p>The undermining of the international
legal order and the transition to a polycentric world generate instability. The annual growth of defence spending is a clear sign that the security environment
is not improving and that mistrust is increasing.</p><p>The pursuit of technological
supremacy designed to achieve political supremacy isolates science in a narrow
geographical framework, triggers scientific migration and widens the gap
between states, which President Putin described in detail. </p><p>Uneven growth has turned many beliefs
inside out and has given birth to a new world. Who could have imagined 20 years
ago that China would be the primary champion of free trade while the US would push
protectionism? Who could have claimed that Europe, which had been promoting a model of tolerance, would see neo-Nazi and nationalist movements rise up due to the pressures of social disparities and migration? </p><p>This is the reason I believe that
sustainable development cannot be fulfilled solely by reaching a set of economic, social and environmental goals explicitly designed in the UN 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development and enshrined in the European Union’s major policies and programmes.</p><p>Coping with existing challenges
requires a comprehensive approach with a wide range of tools – from political
to cultural. A new supra-national outlook should be bred in the planet’s
residents, and while the young already possess it, we, the politicians, still
cannot afford it since the world remains an arena of competition and conflicts
between nations.</p><p>Nevertheless, nature is sending an imperative call to overcome the limitations of our own egotism. Our
predecessors overcame their differences and established the post-war global
order for the sake of peace. The UN was a key to this, and they displayed this
wisdom at the onset of the Cold War.</p><p>We must do the same now; however,
this time, it should be done for the survival of the planet and humankind. A new
economic paradigm should offset the scarcity or lack of resources with human
capability and genius. This paradigm should rely on knowledge, technology and innovation. I am confident that it should be a green economy rooted in the concept of open science, in a new consumer culture, in new manufacturing ethics
that should be included in education curricula and economic strategies.</p><p>Sustainable development necessitates more
effective global security mechanisms. They should help limit the use of unilateral actions and force and create privileged conditions for dialogue and multilateral diplomacy, which is under pressure, as well as prevent
polarisation and radicalisation.</p><p>Sustainable development includes the prevention
of financial crises, which implies a more accurate regulation of financial
markets. Global consensus is needed to fight corruption, which has emerged as a cross-border phenomenon, money laundering and tax evasion, as well as on limiting the operation of offshore jurisdictions. I am confident that all
political leaders are well aware of these problems, and in this regard, they
must show one single will.</p><p>Sustainable development is impossible without
security and social peace. Eliminating a massive famine is not enough for true
stability. That is why migration waves are not subsiding, and the number of refugees is increasing. It is insecurity and poverty that lead people to emigrate and that fuel xenophobia and nationalist movements in their host
countries. So we need an effective model that can provide for security and stability, investment in the economy, in education and healthcare in the countries of origin of these migration waves.</p><p>Sustainable development is impossible without
sustainable trust. I will give this example. Seventy years ago, Bulgaria was
the second country to recognise the People’s Republic of China and establish
diplomatic relations with it. Since then, relations between our peoples have
been developing in a spirit of trust and friendship, despite the political
environment. We could even say that because the first state that recognised
China no longer exists, we could say Bulgaria was the first.</p><p>And that is why sustainable development is not
only a political and economic challenge; it is a stage in the cultural
maturation of humankind. It is based on mutual recognition and acceptance of national culture codes. Cultural differences have a major effect on the security environment. When they are not identified, recognised or accepted as something
the other has a right to, they create distrust, risks to security, and consequently,
to sustainable development. It is the lack of cultural communication that underlies
the other’s perception as an enemy.</p><p>I would like to quote an outstanding Bulgarian revolutionary Gotse
Delchev, who said more than 120 years ago: “I understand the world solely as a field for cultural competition among the peoples.”</p><p>I am quoting this for a reason, because
my country is proud of its contribution to the treasury of world culture. A prominent
citizen of St Petersburg, Professor Dmitry Likhachov, called my homeland a country
of spirit, because Russia inherited its writing script from Bulgaria. Both
Christian religion and Old Bulgarian Slavonic language spread to Russia from
our land. Many millennia later, in 1878, Bulgaria gained its freedom through
Russia, for which
thousands
of Russian soldiers gave their lives. We Bulgarians never forget this. It is an example of how strong cultural ties can withstand historical trials and tribulations.</p><p>I remember another world-famous
citizen of St Petersburg – maestro Valery Gergiev, whom I have the privilege to know personally. From Beijing through Brussels to Washington, he asserts the power of culture, which sweeps away borders, proving that the eternal power of art is above any divisiveness.</p><p>During his last concert in Sofia,
the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra gradually softened its sound to <i>pianissimo</i>. Quieter and quieter, until
the sounds in the crowded room had completely subsided, and the audience not only
listened, but absorbed every sound, as if for the first time we heard the quiet
but distinct voice of each of the 150 instruments, all at the same time. After
the concert, I asked the maestro: “How is this possible? How could we hear and understand the quiet part of the performance better than the louder parts?” He
answered: “Force is important. But melody and harmony are far more important.”</p><p>It may be time for us politicians
to cut the decibels, because we are still far from the harmony that the citizens of the world expect from us; but this is a good time for us to start listening
to each other. I think the number of people aspiring to act like the conductor of the world orchestra is constantly growing, but each of them comes with their own
music score, often without even having greeted the orchestra.</p><p>If we want to achieve the sustainable development of mankind, we need to write and establish clear rules for a five-line staff and the notes themselves, and should write the music
together, taking into account the specifics of each individual instrument in the orchestra. I think the platform for such work is the United Nations. Until
we begin to respect this organisation, use its powerful potential, strengthen
its means and mechanisms, we will not be able to produce a melody – only fragmentation,
tension and conflicts.</p><p>I wish this forum success, more
harmony and the achievement of the goals set forth in the UN 2030 Agenda.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> Thank you very much, President Radev.</p><p><b>Rumen Radev</b>: May I take a minute, please? </p><p>I am
tempted to take advantage of this great forum and to address the world business
at the forum. I highly encourage you to come and invest in Bulgaria. I will use
just one single example, and this example is the German-Bulgarian economic
cooperation. Twenty years ago we started from ground zero. There was nothing.
Now we have thousands of German companies operating in Bulgaria and growing and expanding in Bulgaria. Last year we scored 8.3 billion euro trade turnover. We
exported products for 4.3 billion euro to Germany. However, this is not food
and wine, as many could expect. We produce in Bulgaria and export to Germany
high added value products: electronics, machinery, sophisticated and complex
systems and components for all types of German cars. Our capital Sofia is in top ten worldwide for start-up companies and IT development. So, take your chance.
Thank you.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> Thank you very much. During our discussion you will be able to speak
more on why business should invest in Bulgaria. Thank you for your wonderful
speech.</p><p>Mr Pashinyan, you are next, please. </p><p><b>Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan </b><i>(retranslated)</i><b>:</b> President
Putin, President Xi Jinping, President Radev, Prime Minister Pellegrini,
Secretary-General Guterres, Ms Shevardnadze,</p><p>I will start with traditional words
of gratitude for holding this meeting, for a chance to share ideas on the paths
of development for our country and the challenges our government faces in reaching these goals.</p><p>Today, Armenia is going through a vital period in its contemporary history. Radical changes are taking place in the country in terms of political stability and unprecedented levels of the legitimacy of the authorities. The ultimate goal is creating a competitive and technologically advanced economy and a modern society based on the universal
principles of equality, justice and rule of law.</p><p>What is the essence of the changes?
Briefly, they are aimed at raising the efficiency of our political, state and economic institutions.</p><p>Armenia is a land-locked country
with limited economic and natural resources, and a difficult geographical
situation from the point of view of logistics corridors and the geopolitical
peculiarities of the region.</p><p>All these issues are in a way
pushing us to constant activities to increase competitiveness and efficiency.
What does that mean to us?</p><p>First, it means increasing the efficiency of the public administration system. I can say with confidence that
we have already managed to achieve tangible results. The country has done away
with systemic corruption and the activities of artificial monopolies and oligopolies have been brought to a minimum.</p><p>However, in the course of our efforts to improve the economic and political environment in our country, we faced a fundamental problem. The country’s judicial authority, unlike the executive and legislative branches, where we see major progress and the optimisation of institutions, has not undergone any tangible transformation. As a result, there
was a huge gap in public trust in the judiciary, and this in turn creates
serious obstacles to the country’s development as a whole.</p><p>All our efforts to protect capital and create
equal conditions for economic activity and a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment will not bring about the desired result if the judiciary does not undergo a major transformation. Therefore, creating a truly
independent judiciary, free from corruption and political influence, is a pressing problem for our society and a priority in the Armenian government’s
reform strategy.</p><p>The second point is making full use of the potential of foreign economic ties and participating in international
integration projects. For countries such as Armenia, the institutionalisation
of access to the centres of the global economy and activity is very important.
This primarily concerns our cooperation with the Russian Federation and participation in the Eurasian Economic Union.</p><p>We are committed to further improvement of our
strategic partnership with Russia and the most productive participation in the Union. For this purpose, we will make every effort to improve cooperation
mechanisms and maximise the integration between the members of our association.
This also applies to our CSTO membership.</p><p>I would like to emphasise our interest in expanding the geography of the EAEU’s foreign economic relations. China is of particular importance in this sense. I am pleased to note that over the past
month, our bilateral relations have been rapidly advancing with that country,
which plays a key role in the global economy.</p><p>As a Eurasian Economic Union member
we think it important to establish institutional interaction between different
integration associations and projects. I believe the idea of aligning the EAEU
and the Silk Road Economic Belt is a priority. The idea is quite logical and rational.</p><p>I also consider the policy of enhancing cooperation between the EAEU and the European Union promising. I think this cooperation is quite possible and even inevitable in the mid-term,
if not in the immediate future. </p><p>Armenia has a treaty with the EU on comprehensive and enhanced partnership which we are set to make the best use of for designing and implementing our reforms. The EU partnership is in no way at variance with our Eurasian Economic Union membership; it supplements the enriching of our opportunities with new and comparable advantages.</p><p>Third is the maximum efficiency of the human resource potential of the country. Our major asset is people, and government activities pursue the creation of conditions for the free fulfilment
of the creative, intellectual and business potential of our citizens. We are in fact determined to turn Armenia into a paradise for talented people.</p><p>We see Armenia’s future in developing an innovation economy. There is no alternative for a country like
Armenia.</p><p>The technology sector is among our
priorities. In this context education gains special significance for us.
Armenia inherited a good school of physics and mathematics from the Soviet era.
Today we are doing everything we can to consolidate and apply this potential.</p><p>The IT sector has grown five-fold in Armenia in the past seven years. It has become a driver of the country’s
economic growth and its most promising industry. Education and innovation,
cooperation and integration, the established rule of law and effective management – this is where we see our
potential advantages that will allow us to fully utilise our resources and build conditions for sustainable economic development.</p><p>Honestly, I think we have already
embarked on that road because the first quarter showed 7.1 percent GDP growth
in Armenia. Economic activity increased by 9.2 percent in April. So, we also
invite international business to invest in Armenia. We even have a slogan for potential
investors – we invite them to Armenia to become richer and to make our country
more prosperous.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Thank you, Prime Minister Pashinyan.</p><p>Prime Minister Pellegrini, please go
ahead.</p><p><b>Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic Peter
Pellegrini</b>: Dear Mr
President Putin, dear Mr President Xi Jinping, dear Mr President Radev, dear Mr
Prime Minister Pashinyan, dear Secretary-General, excellences, ladies and gentlemen. </p><p>It is a privilege for me to join you today, in this discussion devoted to sustainable
development goals. And I am very pleased that organisers opted for this topic,
and my special thanks goes to President Putin for opening the gates of St
Petersburg to world leaders and thinkers from all around the world. Thank you
very much. </p><p>Three and a half years ago, the international community came together in even wider
setting, and we committed to work together for humanity. The adoption of the 2030
Agenda and its 17 sustainable development goals was a remarkable success. We
are here to understand it is a global reference framework for development worldwide,
with a clear vision and benchmarks, taking into account the 4<sup>th</sup>
Industrial Revolution, climate change, security threats. Never before we had a universal
strategy ensuring coherence among economic, social and environmental policies,
and this is the 2030 Agenda. We need everyone onboard. Sustainable development
is our duty towards future generations. </p><p>Recent UN reports
show urgent need for more progress. We have to understand that each one of us
deals with the issues of sustainability on a daily basis. But the time is
running out, and the chances of achieving some of our goals are already at risk. </p><p>So where
are the leaks? From my perspective, there are two main issues. First, on financing.
The 2030 Agenda draws our attention to a number of elements which are crucial
for sustainability but tend to be overlooked. We need five to seven trillion US
dollars of global investment annually, and that’s between seven to ten percent
of the global GDP. A year ago, at this place, Christine Lagarde said that we
are seeing storms in the forecast. And she warned against the level and the burden of national and corporate debt, financial fragility which will result in significant capital outflows from emerging and low-income countries and the determination of some to rock the system that has presided over the trade
relationships.</p><p>60% of global GDP is created in the private sector. So we cannot no more rely on public funding only, and make forecasts on financial fragility. I see public
figures here, sitting next to business leaders, so let’s talk on how to combine
public and private resources in a meaningful way. The good news is that many
businesses are willing to help out. But the bad news is, only 17% of the businesses have actually introduced any relevant plans or policies to materialise
this support. So clearly, we really need to make some effort here. </p><p>Sustainability
requires a framework for business planning and decision-making, too. There is a lack of experience of Slovak companies in the development business when
compared to traditional donors, but we try. The 72<sup>nd </sup>UNGA presidency
under Slovakia called for a better implementation; it was our idea to host a high level event dedicated to the topics of the FD SDG financing. Representatives
of businesses, think tanks, investment banks and non-traditional donors came together
to take stock of various initiatives and best practices in removing barriers to investment and development. You can find them assembled in the toolbox, an online
repository of lessons learned on the website hosted by UNCTAD. It already
contains more than 40 examples to learn from, and is constantly updated. </p><p>Which
brings me directly to the second issue, to which I would like to draw your attention – namely, on communicating and networking. Unlike the millennium development
goals, sustainable development goals apply to all, not only to developing
countries. But it is not for the UN alone to deliver on them. We have to change
our rhetoric when communicating SDGs. We have to find a common language that enables
us to communicate across cultural and geographical boundaries. We need shared
responsibility for the world, stressed Chancellor Angela Merkel at the Global Solution
Summit in March this year. Also emphasised by President Macron: at a time when our
collective system is falling apart, sadly, it is most in demand. And I could
not agree more. Interdependence has to become a driver and not an obstacle. And we need to infuse this agenda and its spirit into all areas of our work. In Slovakia, we have taken the necessary steps to integrate the 2030 Agenda into
our long-term national development framework. We are going even further by linking the SDGs to our national investment plan until 2030 which should boost
the financing for sustainable development. But we need a vision of where we
want to have our country and the whole European Union in eleven, in the next
eleven, in the next ten, in the next twenty, thirty years. And we cannot
implement all SDGs in all their height, width and length. We have therefore
decided to define our national priorities for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
And this was done in a broad stakeholder participation process, respecting the principles and values of an open government. </p><p>My country
is indeed aiming at using our role, weight and leadership in international
organisations to push the SDG agenda forward. As a current chair in office of the OSCE, we are determined to help foster peaceful, just and inclusive societies which
are free from fear and violence in line with SDG 16. And I would like to say very
clear and very loud: there can be no sustainable development without peace and no peace without sustainable development. And we support meaningful and comprehensive
dialogue among states as well as with other partners at the national, regional
and international levels. </p><p>Dear
President Putin, </p><p>Last year,
you called for a technological breakthrough and mentioned very importantly that
we must be receptive to innovative ideas and technologies that make a difference
in people’s life and determine the future of the country and the world. These
are your words, Mr President. In May 2019, Slovakia chaired the OECD
Ministerial Council under the theme, Harnessing Digital Transition For Sustainable Development Opportunities and Challenges. And the mission is to use
the potential of the new digitalisation era and to ensure it is for the benefit
of all. </p><p>In my keynote
speech to the OECD ministerial, I suggested that digital humanism needs to become the decisive philosophical orientation of the 21<sup>st</sup> century.
Digital humanism means that human beings remain the central focus of the digital transformation, while digitalisation should be approached in its
entirety and complexity for the improvement of people’s life and the preservation of our planet. Digital humanism that seeks to enable people to achieve things they never believed possible, empowered by the use of technologies. And it is our job as policymakers that they do so while
representing the law, ethics, fundamental freedoms, democratic principles and human rights. </p><p>Slovakia as an industrial country also has to cope with the situation of producing in a more
and more virtual world. A decade ago – a utopia, in ten years – a reality. Just
as companies have to learn how to do sustainable business, young people have to gain skills for living sustainable lifestyles. We have to bear in mind that
more than 50 percent of the world population is under 30. Youth play the central role in development. They are actors of changes; youth is at the same
time actors of environmental changes. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, the chances of achieving some of our goals are already at risk. We
need action, and we need it now. And we need to stay united. </p><p>Thank you
very much.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Thank you, Mr Pellegrini.</p><p>Mr Secretary-General, please go
ahead.</p><p><b>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres</b>: President Putin, heads of state
and government, ladies and gentlemen, all protocol observed. </p><p>I am very
pleased to be making my second visit to this prestigious forum as Secretary-General of the United Nations. And I thank President Putin and the people of the Russian Federation for hosting this dynamic gathering. </p><p>St
Petersburg was home to many of the seminal events that marked the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. And today, the St Petersburg Forum embodies the 21<sup>st</sup>
century truth: global challenges require global solutions. No country and no
organisation can do it alone. And we need political leaders, the business
world, scientists, scholars, philanthropists and civil society to join hands in addressing shared threats and pursuing common opportunities. And that is why we
are here.</p><p>For nearly
75 years, the arrangements established after the Second World War have saved
lives, advanced economic progress, upheld human rights and prevented a third
descent into global conflict and catastrophe. Yet, today international
cooperation is under immense pressure, and the values of the United Nations
Charter are being challenged and undercut. </p><p>Today I would like to highlight several imperatives on which the spirit of St
Petersburg, the spirit of international cooperation, can help us prevail.
First, building a fair globalisation that works for all. No one can doubt the many benefits of globalisation. More people have risen out of extreme poverty
than ever before; more people are living longer and healthier lives. But the waves of prosperity and growth have not reached all, and there remains a vast
backlog of despair. Hunger is again on the rise. Inequalities are stark,
especially within countries. And levels of youth unemployment are in some parts
of the world simply alarming. Discrimination against women remains pervasive,
and signs of unease are everywhere we look. Growth is slowing down, and trade
tensions are heating up. And financial markets become uncertain. Debt is
rising, limiting what countries can do to achieve their goals and undermining
their ability to act when the crises strike. We need a global economy that
works for all and creates opportunities for all. And the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development points the way. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals
are the world’s agreed blueprint for building a safer, more equitable world and leaving no one behind. But we are not yet on track. And we know what works, and we have important
gains to build on. And so I continue to call for more robust commitment to the world’s agreed blueprint for a better future. Political support is crucial, but
the business community has an absolutely vital role to play. </p><p>Second, we
must address the global climate emergency. We are in a race against time, and we are losing the race. In fact, the reality is proving to be worse than
scientists had foreseen. We are also coming to recognise how climate impacts
are accelerating the drivers of conflict, for instance, in the Sahel, and even
paving the way for expansion of terrorism and extremism in that region. Yet, as global warming speeds up, political will has sometimes slowed down. At the time
when we know that technology is on our side, and when businesses and civil
society are more and more engaged, this lack of political will could be tragic.
We need a green economy, not a grey economy. We need a rapid and deep change in how to do business, how to generate power, how to build cities and how to feed
the world. That means putting a price on carbon, ending subsidies to fossil
fuels. And we need to recognise that this is a race we can win, but we have the tools to tackle the climate crisis. Climate action could also yield a direct
economic gain in $26 trillion compared to business as usual through 2030,
according to a recent economic analysis. And that is why I’m convening a Climate Action Summit at the United Nations in September to mobilise the ambition that can reap these gains. And I’m asking leaders to come not just
with speeches, but with concrete plans and commitment, including on financing.
And I’m asking that they do this not out of generosity, but out of enlightened
self-interest. Climate change is the most important systemic risk the world
faces at this time. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p>One of the primary roles of the United Nations is to look to the horizon and to identify
emerging challenges and opportunities and bring people together to advance our
collective well-being. It is in that spirit that next Monday, a high-level
panel that I established last year, and this is co-chaired by Jack Ma of Ali
Baba and Melinda Gates of the Gates Foundation, will issue its report on recommendations on the future of digital cooperation. </p><p>Technology
continues to transform our world. From bioengineering to artificial
intelligence to data analytics, and from education, health to e-governments and the green economy, digital technologies can turbocharge our work for the sustainable development goals. Yet, as much as technology is a vector of hope,
it is also a source of fear. </p><p>We know
there will be a massive disruption in the labour market – with an enormous
amount of jobs both created and destroyed with artificial intelligence. And that is why we need a massive investment in education, but also a different
sort of education, not just learning things, but learning how to learn and learning across the lifetime. And we also need a new generation of safety nets
for effective social protection for the people negatively impacted. </p><p>Obviously,
the risks go well beyond the labour market. We already see the crippling impact
of cyberattacks as well as the threats to privacy and violations of human
rights. And the internet is simultaneously a remarkable vehicle for connecting
people and a weapon for dividing them through the spread of hate speech. And while
the digital age is taking ever deeper root, nearly half of the world’s
population is still not online. Our shared challenge is to reduce digital
inequality, to build digital capacity and ensure that new technologies are on our side and are a force for good. </p><p>Ladies and gentlemen, </p><p>A new
global landscape is taking shape, even as age-old challenges remain. In today’s
world we live with a strange paradox: the challenges we face are global and can
only be addressed globally. No country alone, no organisation alone can provide
the solutions we need. But at the same time, multilateralism is under attack.
Agreed norms are being eroded, and tensions are rising. We are threatened by global warming, but also by global political warming. They are both dangerous,
but they are both avoidable. </p><p>It is true
that we are slowly moving towards a multipolar world, and that is in itself a very positive evolution. But as history tells us, multipolarity alone does not
guarantee peace. Europe was multipolar 100 years ago, but the multilateral
framework for cooperation and problem-solving was not there, and the result was
a catastrophic world war. It is vital that the world has multilateral
institutions and architecture, and that international relations are based on international law. </p><p>At the same
time, we need new forms of cooperation with other international and regional
organisations, a networked multilateralism, and closer links with businesses,
civil society and other stakeholders with an inclusive multilateralism. And this is the kind of international system we need in the 21<sup>st</sup>
century. Our shared duty for the United Nations and all of you in this room is
to show that we care and that international cooperation can deliver. And that
is why I’m pursuing fundamental reforms of the UN, so that it can better serve
the world and the people. It is why we have also launched the disarmament
agenda, strengthened our response to terrorism and extremism, and will soon be
launching a plan of action to combat hate speech. It is why we are fortifying
peacekeeping, emphasising conflict prevention and pursuing a surge in diplomacy
to resolve protracted conflicts that are causing enormous suffering and unsettling the world. And it is why I appeal to all of you to join with the United Nations and with each other to address the very dynamic problems we face
at this time, and to build a better world we know can be ours. </p><p>We can also
reflect more deeply on our direction as a human family when we mark next year
the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the United Nations and post-war cooperation
at large. As a committed multilateralist, but also as an engineer fond of evidence and facts, I see no other way for our world than to address all the challenges together, with all those who can contribute working for the benefit of all. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Thank you very much, Mr Secretary- General.</p><p>Dear participants, I will try to arrange things in a way that will allow us to discuss the important issues that
you have identified in your speeches. Some, such as climate change, even
overlap.</p><p>Since this is an economic forum,
with your permission, I would like to start with what I believe is the most
important economic news, specifically, the tariff war between China and America.</p><p>President Xi, the first question is
for you. The world’s two largest economies, China and America, stand in opposition. At the same time, they are so intertwined and influence so much the global economy that it is completely unclear how to defend your own interests
and not burn your own house down in the heat of the moment. We are aware of what kind of a negotiator and a “terrific” businessman Mr Trump is. The first
thing he does is break off the existing treaty, then stop playing by those
rules. Then, the necessary talks begin, and eventually he gets a treaty that is
good for him. Anyway, this was the case with NAFTA and Japan. How will this
play out with you?</p><p><b>Xi Jinping</b>:
Thank you.</p><p>Perhaps I have an answer to this
question in my files, I am not sure. (<i>Applause</i>.)</p><p>In fact, you have raised the issue
of the relationship between globalisation and anti-globalisation and the waves
around these matters. I outlined our position on globalisation in my speech
saying that we are strong supporters of globalisation. An alleged change in China’s position was just announced. China has already become the largest
proponent of globalisation. This is an objective trend. This is the way it is,
because globalisation is a historical trend which will continue unabated.
Anti-globalisation is also a development today. I think it is similar to a small section in a big wave, which can cause certain fluctuations, but is
unable to stop the general trend of globalisation.</p><p>Globalisation is a double-edged sword, it cuts
both ways. Typically, one benefits and the other suffers. This is a matter of sharing
benefits and interests. But we should not cut off our noses to spite our faces.
We should not maintain a one-sided and protectionist approach.</p><p>Of course, fundamental values do not always
correspond to the wishes of each interested party: sometimes they do, sometimes
they do not. If you are talking about global benefit, then we must adhere to this principle, and the world will be harmonious. We should not be
self-serving.</p><p>We can see that today the issues and problems
of economic globalisation require immediate solutions. Some ideas arise from
the process of globalisation management, technical malfunctions can appear in this machine for globalisation management, but we should adhere to the trend
and defend the existing multilateral trade system. We are not suggesting that
we need to start all over again and turn everything upside down. We should
consider how to improve the existing system and mechanisms.</p><p>President Putin just said in his
speech that the most important thing is that there are many countries in the world, and that all of us are brothers; there are big and small countries, but
everyone is equal. It is necessary to proceed from mutual respect in resolving
disputes.</p><p>I believe that social systems and the development path of all countries should be respected. For example, new
economies are developing and the role of developing countries is growing based
on the existing world order with consideration for the latest changes.
Therefore, new countries with emerging markets and developing countries — their
right to vote and their participation in international organisations must be
respected. Only this will allow us to reach more rational processes.</p><p>We always adhere to peaceful
coexistence. Despite the existing difference of opinions, it is still necessary
to find points of contact and properly resolve disputes that arise. I hope for such mutual respect in building relations with all countries.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Thank you, President Xi.</p><p>President Putin, President Xi has defined the tariff war as a fight between globalisation and anti-globalisation. I do not
know whether you see it like that, but my main question is: where is Russia's
place in this fight for economic supremacy, and should Russia choose one
economic paradigm?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: There is a good Chinese proverb
that says “when tigers fight in the valley, the smart monkey sits aside and waits to see who wins.” </p><p>But things change. And this picture is also
changing. What is changing exactly? The fact is that today, we adhere to the same principles that the world was guided by only recently, and the United
States, the world’s leading economy by a number of indicators, remains exactly
as it was, a high-tech economy that has always promoted the ideas of free trade
and democracy in the international economic arena. But today we see what is
happening – they are introducing a different practice – I said as much in my remarks. As strong competitors emerge and gain strength, such tools suddenly
become unacceptable to them, and various restrictions come into play like
tariff wars and tariff restrictions. This, by the way, causes great damage.</p><p>Yesterday I met with the leaders of large
investment companies, and cited these figures to them – these are not our
figures, these are international figures, from international institutions, the World Bank in particular – if by 2022 these restrictions are still growing at the same rate as today, it will lead to a 2 percent decline in global GDP
growth and will cut global trade by 17 percent. We are certainly not happy
about this scenario.</p><p>Allow me to remind you that during the global
economic and financial crisis of 2008–2009, global GDP growth slowed by exactly
2 percent, while trade growth slowed by 10 percent. If today’s trend continues,
everyone here, including your colleagues, ladies and gentlemen, will face big
problems and tremendous losses. Business will incur losses. Who will they shift
their losses to? To our citizens. New jobs will not be created; on the contrary, jobs will be cut. Money will not flow to budgets at all levels, and so on. This will have very serious negative consequences. We do not want this
to happen, of course.</p><p>Where is our place? It is in the fight for fair, democratic principles in the development of international economic
relations. As you know, our relations with China are expanding, and with other
countries, too; despite all the attempts to hamper certain projects, trade is
growing, thank God. But if trends like today’s persist, it will be bad for everyone. We will certainly try to build relations based on equality and on the principles that I spoke of in my speech.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze: </b>Mr Guterres, nevertheless, the confrontation between the US and China in a way extends to the UN as well. The US does not hide, for example, that it
does not support China’s Belt and Road initiative, fearing that it would give
China a geopolitical advantage in the world in addition to an economic
advantage. </p><p>I know that you repeatedly spoke in favour of this initiative because, as you believe, it is very good for third-world countries. China invests a lot of money in infrastructure. What
will come of the differences between your opinions and the policy of such an important UN donor as the US? Or can we say that informal leadership in the UN
is going to China?</p><p><b>Antonio Guterres: </b>A Spanish politician once said that politicians
are the only animals that stumble twice at the same stone. And the world has
stumbled into a cold war, and we all know what a cold war means. I think our
duty is to avoid the world to fall into another cold war. And another cold war
of two blocs that probably will then be completely separated in a monetary, in a military, but also in a trade and technology perspective. This would be
extremely dangerous for us all, and we need to do everything to avoid it. </p><p>And we can
only avoid it by rebuilding trust, and to rebuild trust, there is a first thing
that is essential – to respect international law. And another thing that is
essential is to contribute to multipolarity in our world. I do not see the world only as the United States and China, with all due respect for President
Xi Jinping. I think it’s the United States, it’s China, it’s the Russian
Federation, it’s the European Union, it’s India, it’s many other countries. And it is the capacity for all these countries on an equal basis to have a relationship based on equality, on trust and on respect of international law
that we can build a world that avoids this trade war, this cold war. And I think the United Nations must be the platform that helps to make this possible,
and we need to learn from the mistakes made in the past. There is no solution
that one country alone can promote. There is no solution that one institution
alone can promote. If we want to address the enormous challenges we face we
need serious international cooperation. And so, it is my true belief that the present situation needs to be overcome and that this sleepwalking into a cold
war needs to be stopped. </p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze: </b>Yes, of course, we should overcome this together. </p><p>We have two representatives of the European Union here. Perhaps we should come to you, Mr Pellegrini? I would like
to know the EU’s opinion of what is going on because a tariff war of your own
is taking shape between you and the US. The US still intends to put tariffs on European cars. This could hit Europe quite hard. </p><p>In the case of China, we can say
that this conflict has been brewing, it has deep roots, it did not begin today,
but in the case of Europe, which is a US ally, I’ve got the feeling that it is
strictly Trump’s story. Does the EU share this opinion? </p><p><b>Peter Pellegrini: </b>Thank you for this question. </p><p>It is very
difficult, because not only the European Union, but also Slovakia as a member
of the European Union would have been very strong, it would have a very strong
impact on our economy also. You mentioned, for example, the automotive sector.
During my visit one month ago with President Trump, I explained to him that an action against the European Union in tariffs on cars and industrial products
would impact not just Germany, but also Slovakia, the Czech Republic and, as you mentioned, it means they are allies, and they are friends. And we also do
not understand if friends are doing each other such things. So now the side of the offer from the European Union in this moment is not to increase tariffs,
but to put tariffs on zero. It would even increase the business between the United States and the European Union, on average maybe eight or nine billion
euros from both sides, so it would be a nice win-win situation. So we are lucky
in this moment that Mr President postponed his decision for another six months,
but we do not know what will be when these six months are over. And we hope we
will not start a trade war, because it will not help, even not the United
States. It will not just make something wrong towards the European Union; it is
also bad for them. I believe that we will be able, in a normal dialogue, to finish this situation in a positive way because otherwise we will lose jobs, as President Putin mentioned, we will lose jobs. We will not have any more such
economic growth that we have now, and it will really create not a pleasant
situation within the countries of the European Union. So I believe in a healthy
brain of all who are involved, that it will be a positive decision at the end.
I hope so. But you never know.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze: </b>Thank you very much.</p><p>President Putin, we are talking
about allies now. Today China is considered to be Russia’s most important ally.
You have met with President Xi more than with other leaders. The same is true
of President Xi. He even called you his closest friend. Two days ago you signed
many important agreements. Trade between China and Russia has reached $108
billion, which is a record. But if we subtract raw materials from this figure,
other economic indicators, even concerning military cooperation, in fact show
that Chinese-Russian friendship and cooperation are not that close after all.
Why?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> First of all, I would like to add a few words to what our guest from Slovakia has said. This analysis is absolutely
correct. I would like to add just one point: this uncertainty in global affairs
and the world economy is now the main factor hampering development. The number
of uncertainty factors is increasing very quickly, and this is the main problem
today. Mr Pellegrini has made a certain sign, and this sign has different
meanings; I hope that common sense will prevail – indeed, I agree with you on this score.</p><p>Speaking of our relations with China, this is
politics, rather than words. Indeed, President Xi Jinping and I have
established very positive personal relations. Yesterday, we spent a lot of time
together and discussed a wide variety of matters. We parted at midnight Moscow
Time or 4 am Beijing Time. We had a lot to discuss. Later, I said: “I have to apologise to you, I should let you go. Hosts should not treat their guests this
way.” But this indicates that our agenda is very extensive. </p><p>Yes, 108 billion. We strove to achieve 100
billion last year, and we reached 108 billion. We have exceeded this target
figure, and our trade continues to grow. Thanks to our joint efforts and to the positions of our Chinese friends, including President Xi Jinping, our trade
patterns continued to change and to improve all the time. The share of engineering goods began to increase. True, this share
decreased slightly last year, but that was due to a number of objective factors.
However, we have no misgivings about this because on the whole we are posting
positive trends.</p><p>First, the energy sector is a major component
of our collaboration, and it also includes a lot of technologies. We have built
an oil pipeline system all the way to the Pacific Ocean, with an offshoot to China. It encompasses many modern technologies. By the way, our Chinese
partners have teamed up with France and joined the Arctic LNG-2 project with
NOVATEK in northern Russia, which will now be implemented. This involves all
kinds of cutting-edge technology. Adjacent sectors facilitating these projects
are also involved.</p><p>We have very good prospects in space
exploration and the aviation industry. We are now moving to implement an ambitious joint project to develop a large transport helicopter. There are very
good prospects in the nuclear engineering sector and the nuclear power industry,
which also involves all sorts of state-of-the-art technologies. The Russian
side has designed and built several nuclear units in China, and we have agreed
to build two more; two are currently under construction. We have a lot of venues in the engineering sector and the power industry. I was happy to hear
our colleagues’ reports in Moscow the other day. To the best of my knowledge,
there are 11 various groups in various fields. Today, we maintain very deep and wide-ranging relations with China; in fact, we don’t have such relations with
any other country. Indeed, we are strategic partners in the full sense of this
word. We can say this without any exaggeration.</p><p>What is especially important is that both
parties show intent to provide an equitable approach to resolving problems.
That is why our colleagues supported the special relationship with China within
the EAEU. We have a very good joint action programme. Yes, there are some
difficult issues related to commodity groups and they need to be discussed at the professional level. I can assure you, our experts and Chinese partners
debate almost each and every issue, but we always find a solution. We strive to look for these solutions and we find them. In this sense, I am sure we have
excellent prospects.</p><p>As for global issues in general, cooperation
between Russia and China on the global stage is undoubtedly a very important
factor of global stability.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Can Russia-China trade relations
replace economic relations with the West for Russia?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Russia can what?</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Can trade relations between Russia
and China take the place of economic relations with the West for Russia?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: You see, we are not creating
military alliances with China. Yes, we are strategic allies. We are not working
against anyone; we are working in our interests and in the interests of our
partners. We are not going to replace anything with anything. Our relations
with the European Union, for instance, have always been multifaceted. Mutual
trade was over $400 billion, then it fell to half of that figure, but that was
absolutely not though any fault of ours: it was not us who imposed all these
restrictions. Now trade is approaching $300 billion, which means that common
sense is prevailing.</p><p>So these two things are not mutually exclusive.
We are ready to work with everyone, including the United States. Mutual trade
there is minimal, though: it was $30 billion, then it fell to $20 billion when
Obama was in office, now under Donald Trump it grew by $5 billion, in spite of some 30 sanctions packages he imposed against us. By the way, the Trump administration
imposed more sanctions than anyone, but mutual trade still has grown somewhat.
We do not set anything against anyone and we are ready to work with everyone.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: President Xi, I began my greetings
by saying that the St Petersburg Forum unites leaders who would not meet
anywhere else in the world, but all of you are united by your dream of the Belt
and Road infrastructure. The trade route from China to Europe cannot be
imagined without Russia, and at the same time Russia is not directly involved
in this project, it is connected with the Belt and Road initiative. What does
this mean in terms of China’s investment in Russia? Will you invest as much in Russia and our infrastructure as the other member countries?</p><p><b>Xi Jinping</b>: It is true, the Belt and Road
initiative is developing more dynamically now. At first, it was very simple:
six years ago, I came up with an initiative of the Silk Road Economic Belt in Kazakhstan, in Astana. Then in Indonesia I suggested the idea of the Maritime
Silk Road. It was very simple at first: we wanted to rekindle the historical
memory of dynamic exchanges between all peoples of the world and to resume
these exchanges in the modern world. That is why I proposed this initiative. It
was well received.</p><p>In ancient times, the Silk Road comprised a limited number of routes, whereas now most countries expressed their interest
in taking part in this initiative. We signed relevant agreements with some 130
countries and 30 international organisations. The result exceeded the achievements
of the original Silk Road. This initiative is now being developed all over the world, even in Latin America and the Pacific.</p><p>This year, we held the second Belt and Road
forum. During the first summit, only heads of state and government of 29 countries,
and, of course, heads of international organisations, including UN
Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, were invited. This year, in response to the great interest in the forum, we invited some 30 heads of state, heads of government, as well as Mr Guterres and the head of the International Monetary
Fund. The hall was full, so we were not able to invite more people, like here,
at this forum.</p><p>What I am saying is that we have this mutual
attraction. We adhere to the principles of joint discussion, joint
implementation and sharing. This is not just China’s idea – it will benefit everyone.
Those countries that did not want to participate at first, said maybe that was
a Marshall Plan Chinese-style. But we do not want that. We do not want to dominate. We have no such plans.</p><p>Perhaps, at first, some participants alleged it
was a Chinese canonisation plan. We have never done canonisation all over the world, never since ancient times. We are ready to adhere to the principles of joint benefit only, while at the same time building our own solutions.
According to this principle, we have long collaborated with our good neighbour,
Russia. We have signed a $20 billion agreement and held restricted and expanded
format meetings with President Putin. We never have enough time. We talk about more
and more problems, and our contacts are deepening. So we want to streamline our
own affairs through the promotion of the Belt and Road initiative, first of all, and then we will work towards a community of shared future for humankind.</p><p>I am sure that this dream will come true.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Thank you, President Xi.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: May I add something?</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Of course.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: You know, Mr Guterres and I attended
the last Belt and Road event in Beijing; I think he will confirm this. Do you
know what I noticed?</p><p>First, all the important global players came.
The European Union was represented at various levels, by various countries, but
there were practically all the leading countries in the European Union.</p><p>And the second thing I noticed, and I think the Secretary-General will confirm this, I would like to emphasise it again. I don’t know if it is my good friend Xi Jinping’s manner, or the Chinese
philosophy – they never impose anything on anyone. They propose. They propose, in fact – I might get it wrong – at the first stage, an investment of over $120 billion in various spheres, and $70 billion I think has
already been invested.</p><p>As for Russia, we have established almost 100
companies with our Chinese partners, created 13,000 jobs – good, high-tech companies – in the Far East alone, in the priority development areas there.</p><p>As for the integration of the EAEU and President
Xi Jinping’s idea, the Belt and Road initiative, we have specific projects
together. There is a road from China to Kazakhstan, which means large infrastructure
projects, and we have to build our road all the way to Kazakhstan. We are actually
behind schedule, because Kazakhstan has already done their part. There are
other projects of this kind. We have very specific plans for joint work, and we
are completely satisfied with them. And I am sure that we will move forward very
successfully.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Thank you.</p><p>I will certainly return to the Belt and Road
initiative.</p><p>Mr Radev, let me ask you too: should Europe be integrated,
the EAEU?</p><p>But, Mr Putin, first a question for you. We are
speaking now about Chinese investment, but here in this hall there are not only
Chinese investors, but investors from all over the world who have invested in Russia or would like to invest in Russia. There was this recent case with
American investor Michael Calvey and his partner Philippe Delpal, who were
detained.</p><p>You always say at all platforms that the law
enforcement agencies and security services should not interfere in economic issues
too much. You also constantly emphasise that the rule of law is above all. But
here it is a bit selective, because Michael Calvey was put under house arrest,
while Philippe Delpal was remanded in custody. This shocked investors because it
looks like you say one thing and then do the opposite. Who should they listen
to? To you, your guarantees, guarantees of President Vladimir Putin, or should
they be guided by what the security agencies are doing?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: In all cases they must be guided
by Russia’s current legislation. This relates both to the government and Russian and foreign businesses. I understand what you are talking about. I am
concerned about this too, otherwise I would not be speaking about it today, but
everyone must respect the law. When we say that law enforcement agencies should
not unjustifiably interfere in the life and activity of business entities, this
is our position. But this also means that all participants in this process,
including businesspeople, must abide by the law.</p><p>What about this case? There was a violation; as you know, he has been accused of embezzling 2.5 billion rubles. Some people,
including many of those present here, his Russian partners, claim he did not do
it. Maybe. But it is the law enforcement agencies’ job to find out. We have a judicial system for this purpose.</p><p>I very much hope that everything will be done
in a transparent and clear way, with the participation of those who defend the position of our American partner, and that just and lawful decisions will be
made. On my part, my colleagues from the Government will monitor the situation.
The Prosecutor General, I see he is here, Mr Chaika, will carefully watch and manage
this process.</p><p>As for the fact that someone was put under
house arrest and someone was remanded in custody. This also relates to what our
French friends told me, that someone has a place to stay in Moscow and someone does
not. How can someone be put under house arrest if he has no house or no
apartment? But we will consider this issue. </p><p>I spoke about the humanisation of these procedures
and we will move in this direction. If there is a possibility to avoid keeping someone
in jail while investigating a case, we need to strive to use this possibility.
Our actions in the near future will be aimed at humanising such processes.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Agreed. I am not trying to defend
anyone in this case, this is not my competence. It is true, your partners, very
reputable people, vouched for Mr Calvey. I am talking of something else now.
Investors were scared by the Calvey case. This is what they see: Mr Calvey has
worked in Russia for 15 years, and if he failed and did not understand the rules of the game, what would happen to them if they come to this country
tomorrow? The rules are obscure, and this is the problem.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Listen, take the Bible and read:
“thou shalt not steal” and “thou shalt not covet your neighbour's wife,” et
cetera, you can find everything there. Mr Calvey has been accused of embezzling
2.5 billion rubles. This must be proved by the law enforcement agencies or the charges must be dropped. That is it, nothing special.</p><p>Look at what happens in other countries.
Businesspeople in the US can be sentenced to 100–150 years in prison, and everyone is fine with it. Do not steal, behave and you will be fine.</p><p>But, I repeat, we will monitor the situation
carefully. And I want to say, there are generally accepted legal regulations. Until
there is a guilty verdict, everyone is considered innocent, including Mr
Calvey. He is considered innocent and I hope that all the procedures will be conducted
in accordance with Russia’s legislation, in a transparent and open manner, and that the Prosecutor General’s Office will monitor the situation.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze: </b>Thank you.</p><p>Mr Radev, I would like to ask you the same
question as I asked Prime Minister Pellegrini, this time as a representative of the European Union, and get back to the Belt and Road initiative. The EU
believes that it is better to present a united front. What do you think?
Perhaps, Bulgaria is better off discussing participation in this project
directly with President Xi? </p><p><b>Rumen Radev:</b> It is a vitally important initiative for us,
for all the 17 countries, we have already 17 countries on board. We also
support the One Belt One Road initiative, but we need to be more effective and more efficient when we work together. We need to know more about each other.
Last year, the Prime Minister of China Li Keqiang visited Bulgaria. When he was
in my office, we started discussing all the untapped opportunity and potential
behind this initiative. I told him, okay, you are going to invest in Europe, we
are going to work together, but let’s open a centre for global partnership for this initiative in Sofia. Why? Because we need feasibility studies for all the projects, we need to optimise them, we need to establish clear criteria on how
to have better efficiency, how not to waste money, which is not worth to do,
but to allocate the money for some other activities. Also we need more
information about our legislation. We need to project information to China about
EU procedures and rules and tenders, everything. So this idea was taken into
consideration; it was proposed at the summit of all the prime ministers
participating in Sofia in July last year. And very soon we are going to open
this centre in Sofia. It is a clear example that we are going forward, and we
have great expectations behind this initiative. Of course, there are some
concerns in some countries, Western, from the members of the initiative, but if
we compare the volume of China investment in the UK, in Germany – they are
huge, there is a huge investment in those countries. So we should not be
concerned. Of course, we should debate all the clear rules for transparency and competition, and we are going to help. </p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> But still, would you prefer to discuss your participation in this initiative directly with President Xi or while presenting a united front together with the EU?</p><p><b>Rumen Radev:</b> If I have a chance to discuss those problems,
of course, Bulgaria has its national interest, we are highly interested in China initiatives, in China investment, in mutual projects, so, of course, we
are ready.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> Thank you. </p><p>Mr Pashinyan, this year, Armenia chairs the Eurasian Economic Union. A relatively small, but I must add, an absolutely
wonderful country is now, so to speak, coordinating all these huge economies on an immense territory. </p><p>You mentioned that your country has recently
signed a cooperation agreement with the EU and that this act does not conflict
with the EAEU. So far. But if your country continues moving towards the EU,
wouldn’t you expect Brussels to ask you to leave the EAEU?</p><p><b>Nikol Pashinyan:</b> Thank you for the question.</p><p>First of all, I would like to say that there is
no movement towards the EU because Armenia is staying exactly where it is. It
is very important to make this clear, since, as I have already said, we
cooperate with the European Union on matters that have to do with our internal
reforms. </p><p>But there is something I would like to emphasise. The EU is very interested in improving relations with Russia. I do,
of course, talk to European leaders; all of them support Armenia’s intentions
to develop relations with the Russian Federation. This is a very important point.
What I am saying is that we are open with our Russian partners about our
relations with the EU before, and we are also open with our European partners
regarding our relations with the Russian Federation. The only exception is
certain defence matters.</p><p>Indeed, very many European leaders are interested
in settling relations with the Russian Federation. I think the presence of two
European leaders here speaks for itself. And I believe a lot of people in the world have now realised that geopolitical games do not benefit anyone, and certainly not those countries that become drawn into them. In this context, Armenia’s
position is clear: we are not going to take part in any geopolitical games and we
are going to develop relations with the Russian Federation. Yes, we take part
in the Eurasian Economic Union, in which we now hold the Presidency. During my recent visit to China I said we are very glad to have a good relationship with
China.</p><p>Why are we interested in these relations?
China, the EU and the Russian Federation pursue global stability, and in these
relations we are primarily interested in global stability and security.
Needless to say, we are aware of our role as an EAEU member state. We will
facilitate the improvement of relations between our partners. Of course, our opportunities
in this respect are not so broad but we will make our contribution to global
security, stability and cooperation.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> I would still like to specify something.
Is it correct to say that in this case Armenia has unequivocally made its
choice in favour of the EAEU?</p><p><b>Nikol Pashinyan</b>: We are members of the Eurasian
Economic Union.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> I know.</p><p><b>Nikol Pashinyan:</b> In other words, this is the only
economic integration process in which we are taking part. We will continue our
participation in it and we will continue developing relations in this process.
But this does not mean that we will not have any relations with China. We will
maintain bilateral relations with China and contribute to the development of ties between China and the EAEU.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze: </b>And what about the EU?</p><p><b>Nikol Pashinyan: </b>We cooperate with the EU. I spoke
about judicial reforms in our country. It is very important for us to create a judicial system that would match European standards. I think this is a very
good goal because when we talk about European standards we mean a truly
independent judiciary that is free of corruption and political pressure.</p><p>As for the rest, we are very happy to have an opportunity to facilitate the improvement and development of ties between the EU and Russia. I think in some cases
Armenia can even become a bridge between the EU, Russia, China and Iran. You
know that the EAEU signed a free trade agreement with Iran. We believe Armenia
can also play and will play a key role in this issue. </p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Mr Putin, the Prime Minister of Armenia believes that Armenia can play
an important role in the rapprochement of the EU, Russia and the EAEU. But so
far, we see that when all post-Soviet countries drift towards the West, it
always happens against the backdrop of heightened tensions with Russia. So far,
it has been impossible to achieve a compromise. You often say that the rules of the game are violated. This also happens because the world is changing and the current rules cannot keep up with it. As far as I can see, it is impossible to integrate into both the EAEU and the EU. You write these rules to a large
extent, at least regarding the EAEU. Can you influence the situation so that it
is not always a matter of making a forced choice but of mutual cooperation?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Look, Charles de Gaulle once spoke about a united space from Portugal to the Urals.
I later added, “to Vladivostok.” There are no serious tensions. There are
concrete things that we need to take into account during these integration
processes. First, integration processes are inevitable, we are witnessing them
all over the world, and we are part of this global process. Naturally, we join
our efforts with the republics of the former Soviet Union. We share a common
language, common infrastructure; there are many things that unite us and create
natural competitive advantages. This is all very natural.</p><p>But there are certain issues we need
to overcome to be part of the integration process, to interact with the European Union. What issues, for instance? Technical regulations: they differ
in Russia and the EU. Do you see what I mean? These are absolutely concrete
issues. The issue of whether to put a screw in this way or that way, or the matter of how snow loads on buildings differ here and there, because we have
more snow in Russia. This is a very natural thing, you see? And we cannot adopt
their technical regulations in industry tomorrow, it is not possible. I admit
that in some areas European standards are better. Some regulations, like
phytosanitary supervision, are tougher in Russia. Therefore, when we speak
about allowing their products into our market, we say, please take into account
our phytosanitary regulations. Some countries are fine with it, some are not. We
need to explain to our partners that such issues cannot be dealt with
unilaterally.</p><p>Or take technical standards. We say:
yes, we will be ready to take your rules and standards, but it will require
time and money because we will have to buy new equipment and introduce these
standards. This will take time, years, and it will require hundreds of billions
in investment. It can’t be done overnight. Our partners should understand this.
They should show understanding for this. </p><p>When we held corresponding talks
with them on this issue, which were linked to our neighbours, we told them that
to even out everything we would need about 15 years with 20 industries. But it was
reduced to one industry over two years. In effect, these talks actually became
prohibitive. You understand how difficult it will be to come to terms. Further,
the European Commission was ready to talk to every EAEU country but not with
the EAEU as a whole because it would be more difficult to talk to us in Russia’s
presence. But eventually, as we see, our partners are now willing to talk with
the EAEU as well. </p><p>Incidentally, note that in Nur-Sultan, formerly Astana, we said trade in the EAEU was growing. I do not
want to quote the figures for fear of making a mistake. But trade between our countries
with third countries has increased even more. What does this indicate? It shows
that when we follow common rules based on WTO principles, it is easier to cooperate with all of us. This cooperation is more reliable and transparent and gives additional impetus to cooperation between the EAEU and third countries.
We only welcome this, and there are no disagreements. All we need is goodwill
to overcome the natural obstacles. We are ready for this and will do it with
pleasure.</p><p><b>Nikol Pashinyan:</b> I would like to add to this, with your permission. When we talk about the Belt and Road, project this is not a matter of choosing between this project
and the EAEU. Armenia faces this issue in other cases because if infrastructure
is built in Armenia, in our region, under the Belt and Road project, there will
be integration between Iran, Armenia and Georgia. I think this will facilitate
the EAEU’s development as well.</p><p>If Armenia, part of the EAEU,
becomes a more progressive state with well-developed economic, political and judicial systems, this will benefit the EAEU and add new nuances to its image.
I would like to recall that, as President Putin said, it is very important to take into account the peculiarities of every country. What is possible in Russia may be impossible in Armenia, what is possible in Armenia may be
impossible in China and what is possible in China may be impossible, for instance, in Bulgaria. However, we should focus on the values that unite us. I believe
there are many values that unite Armenia and Russia, and I believe these values
are immutable. </p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Thank you, Mr Pashinyan. </p><p>Mr Putin, we say there are no
serious conflicts between the EU and the EAEU, that time and will are needed.
However, Ukraine is a graphic example of how a country can be literally split
between these two poles of attraction. In this context I am curious why you
have not congratulated Vladimir Zelensky on becoming President?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Well, he has been clinging to the same rhetoric so far, calling us enemies and aggressors. He must somehow make up his mind on what he wants to achieve and what he wants to do. We are not renouncing all contact with him. We will work
with him. </p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze: </b>Yes, because you are the President of an enormous power. As of today, he
is very popular in his country and has a high rating. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Very good.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: You do not have a history of relationships. One small gesture can
completely change the course of events. You know this, Mr President. Why not
meet him without preconditions? </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Have I ever refused to do this? Nobody has made such an offer to me.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> But are you ready to meet him? </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Listen, I do not know this man. I hope we will get acquainted someday.
Judging by everything I’ve seen, he is a good specialist in the area he has worked
in until now. He is a good actor. <i>(Laughter.)</i>
I am serious and you are laughing. But it is one thing to play someone and another to be someone. Obviously, acting requires talent. Many talents. You can
change your role every ten minutes. The prince and the pauper – every ten
minutes, and you have to be convincing in every role. This is really a talent.</p><p>In order to deal with the affairs of the state, one needs different kinds of qualities. One needs certain
experience, knowledge, the ability to identify the main problems, see them,
find the instruments to solve them, the ability to form a team of capable
people, establish good relations with them, believe in them, give them a chance
to think freely and come up with their own solutions, choose these solutions –
which is very important – and be able to explain to millions of people the motives behind choosing these solutions, and, most importantly, have the bravery and strength of character to take responsibility for their
consequences.</p><p>I am not saying that Mr Zelensky
lacks these qualities; he very well may possess them. There may be a lack of experience, but experience, as people say, can be gained, it comes quickly.
Does he have all the other qualities that I mentioned? He very well may have,
but I do not know as he has not shown them in any way so far. But what we see
is contradictory statements: he says one thing during the election campaign, and another thing afterward. Time will tell. We will see. </p><p>I am not saying that he ruined
everything with his statements without having done anything yet, no. We will
see.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze: </b>I would like to ask you about Belarus. This year Armenia chairs the Eurasian Economic Union, and Belarus will chair it next year. You often meet
with not only the Chair, but also the President of Belarus – in Sochi, in Nur-Sultan. There has been much talk about Russia and Belarus uniting: in terms
of both economies and political structures.</p><p><b>President of Russia Vladimir Putin:</b> Pardon, bad talk?</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze: </b>Much talk.</p><p><b>President of Russia Vladimir Putin: </b>Ah, much.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze: </b>Much talk, yes.People also
say that the unification of the two countries has something to do with the year
2024. Is there some truth is this?</p><p><b>President of Russia Vladimir Putin: </b>No, and there cannot be. I will tell you why:
because it just so happened historically that we are a single people – and I believe that Belarusians, Russians and Ukrainians are one people, I have said
this many times before, many times, and that is my opinion, I am convinced of this.</p><p>At one time, Ukraine did not exist
at all. The Zaporozhian Sich
actually joined the Russian Empire but not as Ukrainians or Russians. What
mattered then? History, language and religion, and they all considered
themselves Russian. Later, Ukraine was formed as “U Kraya,” that is, on the edge of the empire. Proximity to European culture and partial inclusion in Catholic
Poland created a desire to be closer to Europe in this part of the population –
this is a completely legitimate desire and there is nothing wrong with it. </p><p>Prior to World War I, the countries
that were preparing to fight Russia began forming the idea of Ukrainian
identity. This is natural. By destabilizing its
potential enemy, they tried to split it up and take part of it. This idea was embraced
and developed. Part of the population really acquired its own identity, and there is nothing terrible about this. It is a natural process. So, we treat
this with understanding and respect.</p><p>The same is true of Belarus. Again,
I am deeply convinced that there is only one nation. But it so happens that we
live in different countries. Different states were formed. I have expressed my view on this many times. There are no grounds today for a state association. We
do not have plans or goals like this. We plan to develop our Union. I am sure
our people are interested in this. </p><p>Incidentally, much has already been
done in this respect, including in the social area. I am referring to labour
rights, free movement and so on. In some respects, the EAEU has already left
behind our Union State. Much of what was written in the Treaty on the Union
State has not been fulfilled. Mr Lukashenko and I have discussed whether we can
fulfil some of what we did not fulfil before in the present context, or add
something more current. In effect, our whole discussion revolved around these
issues. It was constructive and comradely. Apparently, it is our fault that we
provide too little information for the media and the public. If we did it
properly, there would be no rumours.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> So it is good that I asked this question.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> It is good that you are here at all and ask these questions.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> Mr Radev, I would like to go back to international investment and projects.</p><p>Back in the day, Bulgaria wanted to implement the South Stream project on its territory, but was then forced to halt
it under Brussels’ pressure. I know you were not the president back then, but
you surely know more about this than I do. What was Bulgaria’s motivation in killing the project?</p><p>Because today, there is TurkStream
that runs from Russia to Turkey; we are talking about a line that could
potentially run through your territory as well. Will you be able to defend your
interests this time and overcome your European partners’ scepticism? Basically
I ended up asking you two questions.</p><p><b>President of Bulgaria Rumen Radev: </b>President Putin
has just mentioned something very important: to be able to take responsibility
for your own decisions, so I can take responsibility for my own decisions. At that time, I was not at that position. So I will not go back to history, but
not to forget, Bulgaria is part of the EU, and Bulgaria develops its energy policy
based on the energy policy of the European Union, which means diversification
of roots, sources and suppliers, security of supply and competitiveness. </p><p>Of course,
Bulgaria and Russia, we have been strong strategic partners in the field of energy for decades. Bulgaria is 100% dependent on Russian gas, on Russian
nuclear technologies and fuel for our nuclear power plant, and we had a very
fruitful discussion with President Putin and his team yesterday about how to continue our strategic cooperation for the future. Because there are some
changes in Bulgaria. There are changes on the European gas market, on the European map for gas supply. Bulgaria has been modernising and expanding its
gas transitioning network; we are building reverse capabilities. Also we have
initiated an interconnector between Greece and Bulgaria for LNG gas supply, and all this means that Bulgaria is developing the capability for a gas
distribution centre and establishing its own gas exchange capabilities. This
provides more opportunity for Russia to deliver more gas to Bulgaria and to change the direction, so this gas could flow to Central Europe through
Bulgaria, which is a good opportunity for Russia. </p><p>Of course, we
also need to – this is my opinion, we discussed this yesterday – we need to transform also our relations in how to contract, how to deal with the price of gas deliveries, because there are new changes, I said, on the market. We have
two approaches: one is fixed, long-term prices for pipeline gas, and the other
approach is more flexible prices coming from LNG capabilities, yet they are
very limited. For today, they are limited, but they are already on the market,
so I hope we will find the best approach to meet our interest and to continue
being strategic partners in energy.</p><p><b>President of Russia Vladimir Putin: </b>I will only add a couple of words. President Radev
mentioned the issue of pricing – let us go back at least a little to discussing
economic issues. He said that there is a long-term fixed price and a more
flexible one. Allow me to make a small comment here. The price indeed is
long-term, but not fixed. It is linked to a whole range of energy products,
first and foremost, to crude oil. Oil price fluctuations lead to gas price
fluctuations. The price is absolutely fair and market-oriented. This is the pricing formula. This does not mean, of course, that such a formula must
continue unabated for eternity. We are ready for discussion. But this has to be
done, of course, at the level of economic entities.</p><p>Speaking of South Stream, many
people in Bulgaria regret it falling through – I say this mildly, many of them.
What did Bulgaria lose? $3 billion of investment, a thousand new high-paid jobs
and $400 million worth of transit fees annually. That is it. These are the direct
losses for the Bulgarian economy. And they are worth regretting. And I think it
is quite clear why this happened. Let us be frank: there are certain costs to the Western integration system, which you talked about. This has to do with sovereignty
limitations. By the way, we never face such issues at the EAEU; we can disagree
and argue till we are blue in the face, but every decision is made unanimously,
unanimously or not at all. Problems occur, too, but it is not always the same
in the European Union. </p><p>I have said many times, and I will repeat it
again: today, the European Parliament makes more binding decisions for the EU
countries than the USSR Supreme Soviet once did with respect to the Soviet
republics. This leads to some difficulties, hence the complicated processes
within the EU. But that’s beside the point now, as we are talking about
building new routes that will diversify our commodities supply to Europe. How
many years have we been working on the second leg of Nord Stream? South Stream
even had to be postponed.</p><p>We agreed with Turkey to build the TurkStream,
thanks to the political will of President Erdogan, who showed the best
qualities of his character and underscored his country’s sovereignty, and we
will complete it in the next few months. The offshore section has already been laid,
fully completed, and now the project is progressing on land; we will finish it soon.
So now our European partners will receive gas via a different route, if they
want to, of course. I believe southern Europe is interested in this, because,
once again I’ll repeat, pipeline gas from Russia, considering the distance and volume of deliveries, will always be cheaper, by definition, than liquefied gas
from overseas. Always. </p><p>Mr Miller hides this, thinks it’s a big secret,
but in fact, I think the analysts know the profitability of production – it is one-tenth
of the cost of liquefaction plus delivery to another continent plus re-gasification.
Just cross off a zero, do you understand? He has a good reserve margin in which
he can work with the price, but the price must still be fair for both the seller and the buyer.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Thank you.</p><p><b>Rumen Radev</b>: Just a moment.
Talking about sovereignty limitations – of course, President Putin has his
point of view, but I cannot agree that Bulgaria does not have sovereignty.
Because South Stream was not a project just for Bulgaria. It is a pipeline
going through Bulgaria to other EU countries, so cancelling South Stream was a collective European decision; it was not a sole Bulgarian decision. This should
be clear. </p><p>And, of course,
I fully agree as well that there is a fixed formula, a very complex formula of calculating the price of the gas; it is called the Netherlands formula. I don’t
know why, but the name is that. What I’m talking is to be more flexible and to look beyond today, because there is a huge change, and we need to find again
the best solution for our two countries.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: We will continue to do so, Mr
President. You are right, I agree. Thank you very much.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: President Putin used the word ‘unanimously.’
You also said ‘unanimously.’ In this regard, a short question to you, President
Radev, and to you, Prime Minister Pellegrini, regarding the sanctions.</p><p>Many European leaders speak out saying the sanctions should be lifted because it hurts everyone, not just Russia. The leaders talk, and the sanctions are extended. Can you venture to not support the extension of the sanctions? The sanctions are only extended unanimously, right?
Yes or no?</p><p><b>Peter Pellegrini</b>: There is a position of the European Union, and Slovakia is a part of the European Union;
so, in general, we support. But there is also a position of the Slovak
Republic. And to be honest, we do not think that sanctions are helping
somebody, even not the European Union and even not the Russian Federation. It
is the opposite. The exchange between our two countries, or groups, went down,
as President Putin mentioned, and now we are happy that it is slowly going up
again, and Slovakia will always be first in dialogue, in communication, and not
sanctions at the first point. But in general, that is the position of the European Union. There is now a negotiation, a discussion on how long they
should still continue, but I will again repeat as the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, it is better to sit around the table and to find solutions
than to fight against each other with sanctions. </p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Everyone thinks so, but the sanctions
are extended. Can you vote against an extension?</p><p><b>Rumen Radev</b>: I personally do
not vote because the Prime Minister represents Bulgaria in the European Council,
but anyway. </p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: And if they voted?</p><p><b>Rumen Radev</b>: This question
goes a little far beyond sustainable development, but it is an interesting one.
Being an EU member, Bulgaria is a part of the EU, understanding the position
that sanctions are policy-changing, too, trying to deescalate the tension when
there is a conflict. However, everyone who plans to impose sanctions should
think about the pros and cons and consequences. Sanctions, they are like a coin
with two sides, and the business here knows very well that businesses can
suffer from sanctions, in some areas heavily. Sanctions are not fair because
they do not hit the politicians, but they affect ordinary people. And sanctions
could be circumvented, and I will tell you from our experience that sanctions
could lead to black marketing, illegal trafficking, organised crime. We know
this from experience during the sanctions upon the former Yugoslavia. And one
who plans and contemplates sanctions should calculate very well the outcomes, because
sometimes, the real outcomes are different from the planned effect, and they
could hit back to those who planned and impose sanctions.</p><p><b>Peter Pellegrini</b>: Sorry, but I always like to say what I am thinking, and this moment, and really, I have to say. It looks sometimes very, very funny, when the biggest supporters of sanctions and those who were fighting for sanctions against the Russian
Federation the other day are looking at how they can sell their goods in Russia
and how they can invest in Russia and to grow their own business. So for me it
is sometimes very, very funny how some people are behaving. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: And I don’t see anything wrong
with that. At least we can work with it.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> We have drifted far away from the theme of our forum: Sustainable
Economic Development. I would like to have a short Q&amp;A session. You all
said in your speeches that the existing rules of interaction, of the existing
system of world trade, is not agreeable to anybody in principle; everyone is
unhappy here – China is displeased, so is America, as are the EU and Russia. Mr
Guterres, you say that something is bound to change.</p><p>I would like to hear concrete
proposals as to what needs to change, from each of you. Everyone is unhappy but
does not want to engage in changing anything; nobody is willing. Let’s start
with you, Mr Pashinyan. You might want to see integration between the EAEU and the EU, right? </p><p><b>Nikol Pashinyan</b>: Thank you. The situation is such that if everyone is displeased, we
must do something to make everyone more content. There is only one way to do
this: compromise. We have to work out a compromise. To achieve this, mutual
respect is needed, as Mr Putin said, we need to show understanding for each
other’s interests and respect for them. If all global players see the situation
this way and are ready to take responsibility for such compromises – this is clearly
not an easy thing to do, but it is in fact the only way, because any other
solution will result in big problems.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> President Xi, what would you change? You say an anti-globalisation wave
is surging, and it hurts free trade among other things. What would you change
in the existing trade system to protect free trade, to prevent sliding into
protectionism and isolation?</p><p><b>Xi Jinping:</b>
I would rather be a creator than a destroyer. We must respect what exists. And we must improve it ourselves rather than upset it or cancel it. I do not want
to cause problems for others. Whatever I did, I did it for the sake of being
friends with all nations and expanding the circle of friends for China. I see
friends around the world, only friends. For example, Russia is our great
neighbour. And we are cooperating with the EAEU. We are also strategic partners
with the EU, now also in the 17+1 format. We continue developing relations with
the ASEAN nations, and we have established a cooperation mechanism with Africa,
with most African countries. Our relations are good with Latin America and with
the South Pacific countries. </p><p>As for the United States… even
though we have some trade friction, China and the US are already closely knitted
together. We have large investors and the biggest trade between us. You know, every
day about 10,000 people fly back and forth from the US to China, so it is hard
to imagine a complete separation between the US and China. We are not
interested in that, nor are our US partners. President Trump is my friend, and I am sure that he is not interested in this either.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: President Putin, what would you change? Maybe you could suggest
something specific? </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Almost everything has been said here. With a reliance on compromise, we need to seek common solutions, draft common rules and adhere to the norms of international
law – what was mentioned and suggested by UN Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres. I fully agree with this. </p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> President Radev.</p><p><b>Rumen Radev</b>: I think it is
not about the economy, it is not about a trade war, it is about global
security. Because trade wars, they touch the deepest layers of our security
architecture. I can understand a trade war between the United States and China.
I can understand a trade war between the United States and Russia. But I cannot
understand a trade war between the United States and Europe. When last year, in May, trade war lasted, some of the European leaders were so frustrated that
they started talking that Europe must take its security into its own hands. For a short time period, you can put in one basket, because the economy and defence, they are in one basket. Trade war and being allies – but it is
impossible to be in the same basket, an ally in defence and a rival in the economy. In the long run, you will split. If we split, that will have a devastating effect on the transatlantic bond and the whole European and world
security architecture. I hope that we will find very soon a feasible solution
to fix that problem. </p><p><b>Peter Pellegrini</b>: I think there is
a crisis of multilateralism in this moment in the world, so I think we should
come back and act again according to the international rules to support
international organisations such as the United Nations and the World Trade
Organisation. I think that is the best we can do to come back and to respect
the international rules, and not to fight against each other.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze</b>: Mr Secretary-General, please allow me to formulate the question a bit
differently, in the context of the UN. You said in your speech that now many
important political processes are taking place outside the UN. Can all these
changes that we are discussing today be more successful under the UN aegis? If
you had the freedom to take radical decisions, how would you reform the organisation you head? </p><p><b>Antonio Guterres</b>: Well, first of all, we are reforming the UN in what we can do to reform the UN, and it is
essentially to make the Secretariat and the coordination of our agencies more
transparent, more better coordinated and more accountable. But of course, there
are central questions, and UN-related, about the way this policy works, the General Assembly works. But looking at the UN, looking at the World Trade
Organisation, any other organisation – everything can be reformed, and I am
very much in favour of reform, of improvement. By the way, the World Trade
Organisation has a reform process taking place. The central question for me is
related to the behaviour of the actors. And that is where the major change is
needed. And the first change is to re-establish trust in international
relations. And to establish trust, there are things that are absolutely
essential. First, behaviours need to be rational, and need to be predictable,
and need to be in line with international law. If you are able to do these
things, we can reform the institutions, we can make them better. If you are not
able to do these things, there is no way we will be able to reform the institutions, because we will never agree on the way to do it. So, let us
re-establish trust, let us make sure that key actors in the world act in a way
that is rational, that is predictable. And if that happens, we will be able to improve the way our organisations work in a fantastic way. But let us never
forget: everything is important, but the most important is people, the people
that are assuming responsibilities in the way they are able to shape
international relations based on trust.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze: </b>I promise you that we are almost finished. I literally have one last
question for my President and for President Xi. This is a geopolitical question
because after all I am a foreign affairs journalist and I would not be forgiven
by my colleagues if I don’t ask. Before the forum I discussed this with my chief, Margarita Simonyan, who cannot be here because she was taken to the hospital
for the reasons that you know, President Putin. This is a question about the Korean Peninsula. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Ms Simonyan is pregnant and she says: for the reasons that you know. What do I have to do with this? <i>(Laughter.)</i></p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> Yes, Kim Jong-un met with Mr Trump,
but the talks did not go well. Then he went to Russia. It all comes down to this: who or what guarantees a happy and calm life for the North Korean leader
if not an atomic bomb? You, President Xi, and you, President Putin, said in Vladivostok that in general, international guarantees could make a big difference.
If everyone agrees with this why not give him these guarantees? Maybe it makes
sense to agree here in St Petersburg: two big nuclear powers, we are willing to give guarantees. Mr Trump, are you with us or not? Go ahead please.</p><p><b>Xi Jinping</b>: Indeed,
denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula is already the subject of international agreements. This issue holds the attention of the whole world, in particular, the dialogue between Pyongyang and Washington. I think it is
necessary to become convinced of the prospects for this dialogue. The interested
parties maintain close coordination. This includes President Putin and me – we
are very interested in the problem of the Korean Peninsula. We are working
together in a constructive way to advance the process of a political
settlement.</p><p>It should be said that we need to make
sure, keep our confidence in it and further promote this process towards the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. We are sure that there is the potential
and good chances for this. The key is to work together in this direction. </p><p>Of course, various mechanisms need
to be established to remove the mistrust between the key countries – this is
what we are striving for, and we need to discuss their decisions.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> The issue of the North Korean nuclear programme is definitely a serious
and important one not only for the region but also for the whole world. I totally agree, and we pay a lot of attention to this with our Chinese friends.
Of course, I would like to reaffirm what President Xi said – the key role
should belong to the countries who are the principal rivals – the United States
and North Korea.</p><p>Nevertheless, we have to say that
North Korea abides by its obligations. First it cancelled its nuclear tests and is decommissioning one of the test sites. We hear our US partners say “No, this
is not enough.” Maybe it is not enough but this is what they agreed to.</p><p>On the other hand, we need to consider
a mechanism to provide security for North Korea. Of course, they see the example of Iraq and Libya, and they do not want this. We must bear this in mind
and take it very seriously. The nature of any guarantees can be a very
complicated matter.</p><p>I will not hide and I will not reveal
too big a secret – this problem was also among those discussed yesterday. I do
not have a complete answer now. I think, nobody has such a proposal. By the way, we also talked about this with the Americans, when Mr Pompeo visited. We,
and China, are definitely interested in denuclearisation. We want it, we are
pursuing it, because the spread of WMDs around the world adds up the risks and threats that we normally forget about in our everyday lives. But they are
present, and they are growing, and this of course worries us. </p><p>What sort of guarantees do we need?
This is the key question. It must be a matter for consideration by everyone. In this case what the UN Secretary-General said is of utmost importance here –
trust. Of course, we must propose some sort of a plan. Currently the process is
moving along the road map worked out by Russia and China. On the whole, we are satisfied
with the way the process is unfolding. We are looking forward to President
Trump and the North Korean leader making an arrangement shortly, to re-establish contact and to carry the process further. We will work towards this
in every way we can.</p><p><b>Sophie Shevardnadze:</b> Thank you very much.</p><p>Thank you all for the interesting
discussion.</p><p>I wish you good luck in all your endeavours.
That’s all for today. Have a nice evening!</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> We all wish Margarita Simonyan the very best. Give
her our best wishes.</p>   <div class="read__cut read__cut_full_size masha-ignore" role="complementary" aria-labelledby="43237-cut"> <div class="cut"> <h3 class="cut__title" id="43237-cut">See also</h3>   <div class="cut__description">  <a href="http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/trips/60759" class="cut__item cut__link" target="_blank">All news about the trip to St Petersburg</a> <div class="cut__date">June 6 − 7, 2019</div>  </div>  </div> </div> <div class="read__bottommeta hidden-copy"> <div class="width_limiter">   <div class="read__tags masha-ignore">  <div class="read__tagscol"> <h3>Geography</h3> <ul class="read__taglist"><li><a
