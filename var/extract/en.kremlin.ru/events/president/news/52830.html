for speaking to Bloomberg. Here in Vladivostok we're
on the edge of the Pacific and on the eve
of the second Eastern Economic forum. What do you hope to achieve
at it? </p><p><b>President of Russia Vladimir Putin:</b> We would like to draw
the attention of our partners, of potential investors
to the Russian Far East. In this sense, the Forum
as an event is similar to other regional forums of this
kind. Russia hosts a lot of such forums, including
the International Economic Forum in St Petersburg, (usually
in the beginning of summer), as well
as the Economic Forum in Sochi.</p><p>The Far
East is of particular significance for us in terms of this
region’s priority development. Over the last few years, let us say even
over the last decades, we were faced with many problems here. We paid
little attention to this territory although it deserves a lot more
of it, because it concentrates great wealth as well
as opportunities for Russia’s future development. Not only for Russia
alone, but also for the development of the entire
Asia-Pacific region (APR), because this land is very rich in natural
and mineral resources.</p><p>When
we talk about the Far East we usually mean the Far East itself,
including Primorye Territory, Khabarovsk Territory, Kamchatka, and Chukotka,
as well as Eastern Siberia. All this area contains tremendous
resources, including oil and gas, 90 percent of Russian tin, 30
percent of Russian gold, 35 percent of forest, 70 percent
of Russia’s fish is harvested in the local waters.</p><p>This
is a region with a substantially developed transport
and railroad infrastructure. In recent years we have been actively
developing road connection. There is also a huge potential
for developing the aviation and space industries. As you
might have noticed we have launched a new Russian spaceport in one
of the Far Eastern regions. As I have already said,
the aviation industry, including combat air force, has been traditionally
developing here. It is the Russian Far East where the SU aircraft,
which are well known worldwide, are manufactured.</p><p>Finally,
we are resuming the manufacturing of sea vessels here, first
of all for civilian purposes. Just earlier today I witnessed
the commissioning of one of the most promising sites
of this kind.</p><p>And this
is also a good opportunity for humanitarian exchanges with our
neighbours. Our intention is to develop music, theatre and exhibition
activities here. Just recently Mr Gergiev, a distinguished Russian
musician and conductor, held his concerts here. We are going to set
up a branch of the St Petersburg Mariinsky Theatre here. We are
also planning to open local branches of the Hermitage Museum
and the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet.</p><p>As you
can see, we are now present in the building of the Far
Eastern Federal University. I am sure you too have had a chance
to assess the size of the University – the number
of foreign students studying here is already in the thousands;
there is also a great number of foreign professors. We would like
to see science and higher education developing here, so that it could
become one of the major research centres in the entire APR
system. Undoubtedly a lot remains to be done here, but given
the labour market demand, the relevance of such
a university is undeniable.</p><p>In addition
to everything that I have already mentioned, there is another domain
that we consider relevant and having good prospects – marine biology.
For many years this region has been home for one
of the leading institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences,
the Institute of Marine Biology. You know, we are launching
a new centre here; we have built an oceanarium on its premises,
which is supposed to be not only a public place where people,
I am sure, will enjoy the wildlife, but also part of the Institute
of Marine Biology. A very interesting and promising cluster has
formed here, and we would be happy if our potential investors, our
counterparts from abroad, first of all those from the Asia-Pacific
region, knew more about it.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> One of the guests who have coming is
Shinzo Abe. There seem to be the beginning of a political
deal: you might give up one of the Kuril Islands in exchange
for greater economic cooperation? Are you opened to a deal
of that sort?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We do not trade territories although concluding
a peace treaty with Japan is certainly a key issue and we would
like to find a solution to this problem together with our
Japanese friends. Back in 1956, we signed a treaty
and surprisingly it was ratified both by the Supreme Soviet
of the Soviet Union and the Japanese Parliament. But then
Japan refused to implement it and after that the Soviet Union
also, so to say, nullified all the agreements reached within
the framework of the treaty.</p><p>Some
years ago our Japanese counterparts asked us to resume
the discussions of the issue and so we did meeting them
halfway. Over the passed couple of years the contacts were
practically frozen on the initiative of the Japanese side,
not ours. At the same time, presently our partners have expressed
their eagerness to resume discussions on this issue. It has nothing
to do with any kind of exchange or sale. It is about
the search for a solution when neither party would be
at a disadvantage, when neither party would perceive itself
as conquered or defeated. </p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Are you as close to a deal now
as you have been since the 1960s? Is it better now than any time
since then?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I don’t think that we are closer than
in 1956 but anyway we have resumed our dialogue and agreed that our
foreign ministers and relevant experts at the level
of deputy ministers will intensify this work. Naturally, this issue has
always been a subject of discussions between the Russian
President and the Prime Minister. </p><p>I am
sure that during the meeting with Mr Abe here in Vladivostok this
issue will also be discussed, but finding a solution requires it
to be well thought out and prepared, and I reiterate,
a solution that is not based on the principles of causing
damage, but, on the contrary, on the principles
of creating conditions for developing long-term ties between
the two countries.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> You seem to be more relaxed about
territory in Asia. You mentioned the Kurils, you gave the island
of Tarabarov back to China. Would you consider giving back
Kaliningrad as a tribute?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We handed over nothing, those territories were
disputed and we have been negotiating this issue with the People's
Republic of China, let me stress that, for 40 years, and finally
managed to come to an agreement. One part
of the territory was assigned to Russia, while another
part – to the People's Republic of China. </p><p>Notably,
it was only possible, and this is very important, due
to the high level of trust Russia and China reached
in their relations by that time. If we reach the same level
of trust with Japan, we might be able to reach certain compromises.</p><p>However,
there is a fundamental difference between the issue related
to Japan’s history and our negotiations with China. What is it all
about? The Japanese issue resulted from World War II and is
stipulated in the international instruments on the outcomes
of World War II, while our discussions on border issues with our
Chinese counterparts have nothing to do with World War II or any
other military conflicts. This is the first, or rather, I should
say, the second point.</p><p>Thirdly,
regarding the Western part. You have mentioned Kaliningrad.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> It was a joke. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> All jokes aside. If someone is willing
to reconsider the results of World War II, let us discuss this.
But then we will have to discuss not only Kaliningrad, but also
the eastern lands of Germany, the city of Lvov,
a former part of Poland, and so on, and so forth. There are
also Hungary and Romania on the list. If someone wants
to open this Pandora's box and deal with it, all right, go
for it then.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Can I ask you about the Chinese
again. Back in 2013 you said you set $100 billion of trade with China
as a target for 2015. But it was about $67 billion-$70 billion
a year. What went wrong? I know the problems
to the ruble and problems to the oil. Do you still
think that target of $200 billion in 2020 is achievable?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, I find it absolutely attainable. You
have just listed the causes of this fall in bilateral trade
yourself. At the first stage, we set the target at about
100 billion US dollars, and we almost got there – it
reached 90 billion. So we are almost there. But we also know
the reasons for the fall. These include a decline
in the prices of our traditional export goods
and the exchange rate difference. These are objective reasons.
And you know that very well. </p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Did sanctions make a difference?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> The sanctions have nothing to do with
our relations with China, because our relations with the People's Republic
of China are at an unprecedented high both in terms
of their level and substance. They are what we call
”a comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation“. Sanctions
have nothing to do with this. The decline in our mutual trade
has objective causes, which are the energy prices
and the exchange rate difference. But the physical volumes have
not decreased, quite the opposite actually. They are growing. </p><p>As to our
trade and economic relations with China, they are growing more
and more diverse each day, something we have worked
on for a long time with our partners from China. I would
like to draw your attention to the fact that we have gone from
pure trade in traditional goods (energy resources, such
as hydrocarbons, oil and now natural gas, petrochemicals
on the one hand and textiles and footwear on the other)
to a whole new level of economic cooperation. For example,
we are working together on space programmes. Moreover, we are developing
and soon will begin the production of a heavy helicopter.
We are now tracing the plan for the creation of a wide-body
long-range aircraft. </p><p>Russia
and China also cooperate in mechanical engineering, high-speed
railway transportation, lumber processing, nuclear energy production
and so on. </p><p>We
have built the Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant. Two units are already
operational and are showing good results. There are two more to go.
So, the goal we have set for ourselves, which is to diversify
our cooperation with China, is making progress.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Just listening to you speak I wonder if you
look back, you became president first back in 2000, I wonder if you look back
over that period whether you think Russia has become a little bit more an Asian
country and a little bit less European one?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I'll tell you this: it has
become a more developed country. I would not draw a line between Asia and Europe as the divide lies in a different field – in the level of development.
Since then, Russia's economy has become 1.7 times larger. That is a nearly
two-fold growth. Russia has moved up to the fifth or sixth position in the world in terms of PPP ranking. </p><p>It is absolutely clear
that ten and even less so fifteen years ago we would not have been
able to respond to the sanctions that have been imposed against Russia, with
countermeasures in agriculture, for example. We would not have been able to close our market to the countries making unfriendly steps against us, because
we could not satisfy the demand with our own produce at that time. But now we
can. That is point number one. </p><p>Second, freeing up domestic market
allows our agricultural companies to step up sale cropping inside the country.
Aside from the overall decrease in GDP caused by a number of factors, not
limited to sanctions but also related to the processes in the global economy, —
there is a small decrease in GDP, including in industrial production. However,
the agricultural sector is growing steadily at a yearly pace of 3 percent,
and it will be 3 percent or even more this year and the next year as well. </p><p>So, if we look at was has
changed in the last 15 years, we will see that a lot has happened, but
that is not the only point. Even more importantly, the Russian economy as a whole has been put on a sound footing. In 2000, we had 12 billion in gold
and foreign currency reserves and, if my memory serves me well, a foreign debt
of 20 billion. </p><p>Today, Russia is among the top
ten countries with the best ratio of foreign debt to gold and foreign currency
reserves. As of August 1, 2016, the volume of our gold and foreign
currency reserves amounted to almost $400 billion — $395 billion in fact, with foreign
debt of slightly about 13 percent of GDP. This ratio is among the most
favourable in the world. </p><p>Back in 2000, over 40 million
people, a third of the country’s population, were living below the poverty
line. Since then, this number has dropped almost three times but has been,
unfortunately, growing a little bit due to the economic difficulties and the overall fall in the household income. Still, it is an incomparably lower number
than 15 years ago. Pensions are several times higher now, real wages have
grown substantially; they are now nothing like back then. These are the factors
that helped us achieve what we have fought for and what lays the foundation for a successful development of any state, namely the demography. </p><p>In the early 2000s, it seemed
to us that we could not reverse the negative demographic trend. The Russian
population was decreasing year after year by – I will now tell you a horrifying number – nearly one million people a year, 900,000 to be
precise. In the past three years, we have witnessed natural population growth,
we have the lowest…</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> You're encouraging romance, it seems.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We have the right to say and be proud that we now have the lowest rate of infant mortality
and the lowest maternal mortality in our contemporary history. As far as I know, this was not the case in the Soviet times. </p><p>We set ourselves the goal of increasing life
expectancy. Over the last five years, it has been growing a lot faster than we
expected. All these facts taken together allow us to believe that we are on the right track.</p><p>Certainly, we still can and have a lot to do and we
might have achieved greater results, but on the whole we are doing what has to be done. </p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> You've just talked about the Russian economy, we'll come back and I ask
you about reserves in just a second. But it struck while you're talking in detail in all the ways Russia got stronger. You're about to go to G-20 you have
studied and watched the west many times. You've been to G-20 more than any
other leader at the moment. Have you ever been to G-20 where the west is seen
more divided, more in doubt, more distrustful in itself. Look at all those
things happening in Europe – you look at migration, you look at Brexit, you
look at America with all the election and the problems with that. Does the West
seem particularly disunited at the moment to you. How do you explain that?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> There are many issues
in the global economy in general
and in the western economy as well: population ageing, drop
in labour productivity growth rates. This is obvious. The overall
demographic situation is very complicated. </p><p>Then, the specialists
themselves, and you are one of the best specialists in this
area, probably believe that in the course of EU expansion,
for example, some elements concerning the readiness of some
economies to enter the Eurozone have not been taken into account. </p><p>It is very difficult
to enter a single currency zone having fairly weak economic
parameters and maintain a favourable state of the economy,
not to mention positive growth rates. We have witnessed it not only
in Europe, but for example in Argentina (nearly 10 years ago
or more), when they tied the national currency
to the dollar and later they did not know what to do about
it. It is the same with entering the Eurozone…</p><p><b>John
Micklethwait:</b> Do you expect the euro
to survive?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> I hope so, because we
believe in the fundamental principles of the European
economy. We see that leaders in Western Europe (there are some debates
of course, we also see that and analyse it all) stick to,
I cannot say right or wrong ones, it always depends on someone's
view, but I think, very pragmatic approaches in addressing economic
issues.</p><p>They do not misuse financial
instruments, financial injections, but, first of all, seek structural
change. This is urgent for our economy as well, maybe even more
urgent bearing in mind the problem that we cannot yet deal with,
namely the prevalence of the oil and gas sector
in the Russian Federation and, as a result, dependence
on revenue from oil and gas. </p><p>This is also evident
in Europe, not the dependence on oil and gas, but
the fact that structural reforms are long overdue, and I think
that the leading economies are very pragmatic and efficient
in addressing the issues facing the European economy. That is
why we keep approximately 40 percent of our gold and foreign currency
reserves in euros.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> You expect that Europe won't keep the existing membership, and they
going to lose more like they lost Britain?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> You know, I do not want
to answer your provocative question, though I understand that it may
be interesting.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Come on, many, many times you've criticized Europe…</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> Well, yes, I have
criticized it, but I repeat: we keep 40 percent of our gold
and foreign currency reserves in euros, we are not interested in the collapse
of the Eurozone, but I do not rule out the possibility
of decisions being made that would consolidate a group
of countries equal in economic development and this,
in my opinion, will lead to a consolidation
of the euro. </p><p>But there can also be some
interim decisions in order to keep the present number
of members of the Eurozone unchanged. This is not our job, but
we always follow the actions of our European partners closely
and we wish them luck.</p><p>Now, regarding that criticism
you spoke about. I have criticized foreign policy, but that does not mean
that we should agree with everything. Indeed, we criticize a lot
of things, we think that our partners make many mistakes (may be we make
mistakes too, no one is immune to making mistakes), but
as for the economy, I repeat that, in my opinion,
the European Commission and the leading European economies are
acting very pragmatically and are on the right path.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Can we talk about the Russian economy. I know you will say that exchange
rate a lot depends on central bank and the exchange rate is set by the market.
I saw back in July, on July the 19th when the ruble was 62,8 with the dollar
you said the ruble is too strong, you criticized that. And a ruble is now come
down to 65 to the dollar. Is it weakened enough to make you happy? Or do you
want to see it weakening further?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> I did not criticize
the Central Bank's position. I have always thought
and I still think that the Central Bank should act
independently. Indeed, it does, you can take my word. I do not
interfere in the decisions of the Central Bank
and I do not give instructions to the Bank management
or to its head. </p><p>The Central Bank observes
the economic situation and, of course, I keep in touch both
with the managers and the President of the Central
Bank, but I never give instructions. If I said that the ruble
had become too strong, I did not say that the Central Bank's position
was wrong, I said that it added pressure to export‑oriented sectors of economy. We all understand that this is true.
When the ruble is weaker, it is easier to sell, to produce here
for a cheap ruble and sell for an expensive dollar,
get revenue in dollars and then exchange it for rubles
and get a bigger income. This is simple.</p><p>But if we speak about
fundamental things, regulation of the rate is actually
the function of the main regulator, namely the function
of the Central Bank. And it should think of how
the economy and industry react, but also of its fundamental
tasks in order to ensure the stability of the rate. </p><p>The stability
of the rate is the main issue and the Central Bank
manages to ensure it one way or another. This was finally achieved
after the Central Bank switched to a floating national currency
exchange rate. </p><p>The Central Bank should
take into account other things as well: the stability
of the bank system in the country, the increase
or decrease of money supply in the economy, its influence
on inflation. The Central Bank has a lot to handle
and it is best not to interfere with its competence.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> You personally, would you like to see ruble a little bit weaker still,
with their help? I know it is not you job but you made a comment before. What
do you say now?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You know, my position is that the rate should align with
the level of economic development. Because it is always about
a balance, a balance of interests, and it should reflect
this balance. A balance between those who sell something across
the border and those who benefit from a low rate, as well
as a balance between the interests of those who buy, who
need the rate to be higher. </p><p>A balance between national producers,
for example, agricultural producers who are interested in it. Here we
have 40 million Russian citizens involved in the sphere
of agriculture one way or another. This is very important. We should
not forget either about the interests of the regular consumers
who need the prices in supermarkets to be a little bit
lower. </p><p>Therefore, let me reiterate that the rate should
not meet the interests of a specific group or one
or two groups, it should meet the fundamental development interests
of the economy itself.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> So you are no longer complaining. I will take it that you are not too
unhappy where it is?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I did not express any disagreement, did not complain.
I simply noted that one of the groups, especially exporters,
would prefer to have a weaker rouble.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> You mentioned earlier Russia used to have $500b. Now it is $400
billion. You have this target to get back to $500 billion. What you think is
the realistic target? And your opinion: should the central bank be buying more
dollars in order to push it back up towards $500 billion?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> The Central Bank is constantly purchasing, purchasing
and selling and vice versa – this is their job. I believe
that over the last six months gold and foreign currency reserves
increased by 14 percent. </p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> They gone back up a little bit, but they haven't been buying dollars in the same systematic way as they did once.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You and I know very well about the necessary level
of reserves of the Central Bank as well
as the purpose. We can tell the general public that
the gold and foreign currency reserves of the Central Bank
are not designed to finance the economy, but rather to ensure
foreign trade turnover. Therefore, we need this level to be able
to provide the necessary foreign trade turnover for such
an economy as Russia’s for a period of at least
three months. If everything stops functioning our level will be able
to ensure our trade turnover using its gold and foreign currency
reserves for at least six months or more, which is more than
enough. </p><p>Therefore today we have an absolutely sufficient
level of gold and foreign currency reserves in order
to ensure economic stability and sustainable foreign trade turnover.
All other issues – purchasing and selling of currency – are
related to the regulation of the national currency market.
However, it is still difficult to say what will be the reaction
of the Central Bank and if it would lead to increasing
the gold and foreign currency reserves. Let us not forget that we
have two governmental reserve funds: the Reserve Fund
and the National Wellbeing Fund that represent together
$100 billion.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Can I ask you about the oil price — your
favourite subject. Almost two years ago you said that if crude oil fell below
$80 a barrel there would be a collapse in oil production.
The price is still below $50 and production hasn't stopped. Has your
thinking changed on that at all?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> If I said that
oil production would collapse I was wrong. By the way, I do
not remember when I said this, maybe in the heat
of the moment, but I do not think I even said it, but
I may just not remember it. I was saying that at a certain
level of oil prices new deposits will not be explored. That is what is
actually happening. However, surprisingly, our oil and gas workers (mainly
oilmen) continue to invest. </p><p>Over the past year, oilmen have invested
1.5 trillion rubles, and if we take into account government investments
into the development of pipeline transport and electric energy,
general investments into the energy sector were 3.5 trillion rubles
last year. It is a considerable amount. </p><p>Oil production, energy production are growing, though
the latter has gone down by about 1 percent here, I believe…
By the way, we occupy the first place in the world
in gas export, accounting for 20 percent of the world
market. We are also first in the sphere of liquid hydrocarbons
export.</p><p>Though we still come first in the sphere of gas
export, national production has diminished due to the increasing
volumes of hydrogenation for the electric power industry
and therefore there is a lower need for gas at thermal
power plants. This is the result of the restructuring
of the situation at the national energy market.
In general, Gazprom is doing well and is increasing export
in its traditional partner countries.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> You're going
to talk to Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
at the G-20. Would you still be in favor
of the production freeze if the Saudis want that?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> As far
as I know, Mr. Salman is deputy Crown Prince, but this is not so
important. He is a very active statesman, we have really warm relations.
This is a person who knows what he wants and can achieve his goals.
At the same time I consider him to be a reliable
partner with whom one can negotiate and be sure that agreements with him
will be implemented. </p><p>However, it was not us who refused to freeze oil
production; our Saudi partners changed their point of view
at the last moment and decided to slow down
the adoption of this decision. I would like to reiterate
our position, it remains the same. Firstly, in my conversation
with Prince Salman on this issue I will reiterate our position: we
think that this is the right decision for the world energy
sector. </p><p>Secondly, it is well known what we were arguing about:
if we freeze oil production, everybody should do so, including Iran. But we
understand that the Iranian position is very bad because of the well-known
sanctions against that country, and it would be unfair to leave it
on this sanction level. I believe that in fact it would be
economically reasonable and logical to reach a compromise, I am
sure that everybody understands this. </p><p>This issue is not economic but political. I hope
that all market participants interested in maintaining stable
and reasonable world energy prices will finally make the right
decision.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> So you would be
in favor of a production freeze but giving Iran a little
bit of leeway to do what they need to do?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> I want
to jump back — all these things affect budget. You have budget
deficit, you just given some more money which you mentioned earlier
to pensioners. You will have to borrow sometime. Are you likely
to go this year? And will you go to the domestic market
or will you go to the international market to borrow money?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> There is no
such need at the moment. We do not have to borrow
in the external market, but we have used and are using this
traditional instrument in international financial relations. We have
issued financial instruments in the past, and there is
a strong demand for them, it is simply unnecessary now. Given
the cost of borrowings and the $100 billion
in Government reserves, there is no reason for us to borrow. We
should review the situation carefully. Besides, borrowings are possible,
but we must understand what is more profitable at this point. This is one
point.</p><p>The second. The deficit. Last year
the federal budget deficit was 2.6 percent. I think you would
agree that this is a rather acceptable level. This year, we expect
a slightly higher deficit of about 3 percent, maybe
a little more than 3 percent. It is also an absolutely
acceptable level. But what are we seeking to achieve? We are seeking
to optimize budget spending. I believe that even in such uneasy
times we employ a very pragmatic approach towards economic and social
issues. We do address major social problems and deliver on our
promises to our people. </p><p>The Government has just announced
a four percent indexation of pensions. There has been no
indexation in the second half of the year, but early next
year we will make a one-time payment of 5,000 rubles
to each pensioner, which is actually comparable
to the indexation. We act in a pragmatic and careful
manner. We reduce spending on budget items that do not constitute
a priority. We are not going to waste our reserves and burn them
for any political ambitions. We will act very carefully.</p><p>I hope that there will be no particular need
for us to attract external funding. It is worth noting that despite
the fact the turnover is smaller now we are still maintaining
a trade surplus. I believe that we now have a trade surplus
of $45 billion for the first half of the year. </p><p>Year-on-year inflation has dropped several-fold.
Several-fold! Year-on-year it was about 10 percent compared to last
August, but now it is only a slightly more than 3 percent.
The unemployment rate of 5.7 percent is also acceptable. Our
microeconomic indicators are stable and it gives me reason to believe
that we will calmly and steadily pass this uneasy period in our
economy, which has already no doubt adapted to the current situation.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Can I ask
you about privatization and oil again? The privatization
of Bashneft – you've delayed it. And now as we reported
Igor Sechin of Rosneft just come forward and said he would like to buy
the half of it for $5 billion. You have always said that you
don't want for big state companies to be buying the newly
privatized ones. You wouldn't allow that, would you?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You know, you
have just mentioned state companies. Strictly speaking, Rosneft is not
a company. Let us not forget that BP has a stake in Rosneft
and BP is a British company. You are a subject
of the UK, are you not? It means that you also to a certain
degree…</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> You may have
more control over Rosneft than Theresa May has over BP.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We may have
more control, but my point is that, strictly speaking, it is not
a state company. I think that this is an obvious fact,
as a foreign investor has a 19.7 percent stake in it.
However, given the fact that the State has a controlling stake
in the company, it might not be the best course of action
when one company under State control buys another one fully owned
by the State. This is one point.</p><p>Another point is that ultimately, as far
as the budget is concerned, of major importance is who offers
more money during the bidding that must be organized as a part
of the privatization process. In this sense, we cannot
discriminate against any market participants, not one of them, but this is
not relevant at the moment, as the Government has decided
to postpone the privatization of Bashneft.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> That's gone.
But on the question on privatization, you said back in 2012
that you wanted to expand privatization, you've had a difficult time
on this. Why has that not worked? Is there a case, why does Russian
government need to own 50 percent of these companies? May be you
could sell more?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> There is no
need for the Russian state to hold such large stakes and we
do intend to put our plans into practice. It is not about whether we want
it or not, it is about this being practical or not
and the best timing. In general, it is practical from at least
one point of view – from the point of view
of structural changes in the economy. It is true that
the role of the state in the Russian economy may be
too big today, but from the fiscal standpoint, it is not always practical
to do this in a falling market. That is why we are careful, but
our trend in the privatization process and gradual withdrawal
of the state from certain assets remains unchanged.</p><p>By the way, you have mentioned Rosneft. We
are actively preparing a partial privatization of Rosneft itself. It
is the best proof that our major plans have remained unchanged. Another
example would be one of the largest Russian diamond mining companies
in the world. We are privatizing part of our stake in that
as well.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> ALROSA?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> ALROSA. We are
working in other areas as well, so there are no radical changes
to our position. It is not the case when we have to, as we say,
make a lot of fuss about it. In other words, we do not have
to be obsessed with privatizing immediately and at any cost. No,
we will not do it at any cost. We will do it in a way that
ensures maximum benefit for the Russian state
and the Russian economy.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> So you would do
Rosneft this year, you would sell those shares in Rosneft this year you
hope?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We are getting
ready for the deal this year. I do not know whether
the Government will be able to get ready to conduct this
transaction together with the management of Rosneft itself, whether
the appropriate strategic investors will be found. And I believe
it is about such investors that we should talk. But we are getting ready,
and it is in the current year that we are planning to do
this.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> And do
you, do you again just to push you on that 50 percent, would you be
happy in a world where the Russian state had less than 50
percent of these big companies?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We do not
consider this disastrous at all. You know, I remember that when
foreign shareholders, foreign investors, got 50 percent in one
of our companies, I will not name it now, their contribution
to the federal budget and tax payments increased several times
over at once and the company's efficiency did not decrease.
Therefore, in terms of the interests of the state,
the ultimate interests of the state, in terms of its
fiscal interests, we have a positive experience, most likely, not
a negative one.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Can I push you
on this a little bit? Because when I look on your record over all these years,
in foreign policy you're been very aggressive, very decisive, very bold and everyone agree on that. On economic policy you seem a little more timid.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I do not agree with you. I have acted firmly but not aggressively.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Yes, firmly, rather.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I have acted in accordance with the circumstances.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> But on the economy on the contrast you've been slightly more, you've been less decisive in terms of pushing reforms. If you look at countries like China and Vietnam, you
know, they have changed their economies completely. Russia, as you've said, is
still dependent on oil, still dependent on a few companies, still run largely
by the same people. Do you think that's been failing through out the years that
you have not reformed enough?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> No, I do not think so. Moreover, look, we have carried out a land reform,
and it was hard to imagine that ever being possible here in Russia. Note that,
unlike many countries in the world with a well-developed market economy, we
have, say, the oil sector that is almost completely privatised. Here you have
named Rosneft and Bashneft, all the rest are private companies. And look what
is happening in this sector in Saudi Arabia, in Mexico and in many other
oil-producing countries. </p><p>Why do you think that Russia is less advanced in regard to these reforms?
It’s another thing that, with the high oil prices, it is very difficult to reorient economic actors from the sectors where they get big profits and to encourage them to invest money and resources in other sectors. </p><p>To do that, we need to carry out a whole set of measures, so we are
gradually doing that. Regrettably, the effect might not be as impressive as we
would like it to be – I will finish in a second, be patient – but still the result is there. </p><p>Look, the year before last, the budget received 53 percent from oil
and gas revenues, it was the year before last — 2014, in 2015 it was
43 percent and this year it will be around 36 percent. So, structural
changes also occur. And it is not just the price but also economic growth, the growth of specific production sectors. For example, we currently see a 0.3 percent increase in industrial production in the country in general;
it is small but it is still in place. And, say, in the Far East, where we are now,
the growth of industrial production, industrial in particular, is
5.4 percent.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Let me give you
an example. You've recently made changes on the political side within your
administration. If I look at the business, if I look at a company like Gazprom,
for instance, I just checked in dollar terms, Gazprom is worth less than a fifth of what it was ten years ago, and it's fallen from being in top-10
companies in the world to 198th. And you've had the same manager, running it
for 15 years — Alexey Miller — you've now given him another 5-year contract.
What I'm saying, you're not as tough on business people who are running the oil
side as you might be on other people. Why have you put up with this? You're
famously efficient man.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Look, Gazprom is clearly undervalued, that is absolutely obvious. We are
not going to sell it yet and it is due to peculiarities of the Russian economy,
social sphere and the Russian energy sector. One of Gazprom functions is to ensure smooth operation in the country during the autumn-winter peaks and to supply Russia's large energy sector, and it copes with this task well. I think Gazprom’s
valuations today are quite speculative and we have absolutely no worries and cares about that. </p><p>We know what Gazprom is, what it is worth and what it will be worth in the coming years, in spite of, say, gas development in the United States or somewhere else in the world. Pipe gas will always be cheaper. And Gazprom is
now increasing its exports to the countries that are its traditional partners.
In Europe (see the reports of Gazprom there), especially in recent months, the sales have been growing. </p><p>I am sure, that will continue in the future. Why? Because in the near future, even despite the development of alternative energy, if we look at the economic component and the environmental requirements, there is no other
primary energy source, except for gas, in the world. It could be only nuclear
power. But here, there are also many problems and opponents of nuclear power. With
gas, there are no such opponents. But there is a country that is undoubtedly
the leader in gas reserves. This is our country, the Russian Federation. And Gazprom performs all the functions its management has been entrusted with.</p><p>There are, of course, questions and there are problems. We see them.
I know that Gazprom management is taking the necessary steps in order to solve these problems; it is fighting for its interests in the world markets. It
is another question whether it is being done well or badly. Many criticise
Gazprom, saying that it should have been more flexible and should have
introduced floating prices depending on the current situation in the economy.
However, the gas business is very peculiar. It is not even like oil trade. </p><p>This is a separate business that involves large investments in production
and transportation. And it means that the production companies need to be sure
that they will be able to sell and sell at a certain price. </p><p>You can, of course, negotiate with partners on some floating limits
depending on some conditions. I think it may also be a subject of negotiations,
but if, for example, our European partners want to ensure their competitiveness
in global markets, they should ultimately be interested in long-term contracts
with Gazprom.</p><p>Look, when the prices were high, Gazprom faced a lot of complaints that something should be
done in order to cut a little the ceiling price. Oil prices currently dropped,
and while gas prices depend on oil, nobody thinks about increasing gas prices,
everybody is fine with that. It means that buyer and seller have natural
contradictions. But there is some space for them to reach an agreement in order
to minimise their risks. I suppose they can talk about it.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> I know you're a generous man, but if you had a general who had lost 80 percent of his army, you
might not keep him as a general. Gazprom still has the export monopoly, you
wouldn't think of taking it away from them, given that performance, because it
is worse than other gas companies.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> It's
a different case. Speaking about the general, in this context he lost nothing, he
simply moved it to reserves that can be drawn upon and used at any moment.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> The G-20, this
one will be the last times when you'll see Barack Obama. And as you well know
there is American election on the way and as you well know there is a choice in that between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Who would you rather have at the other end of the telephone if there is geopolitical situation — Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton? Do you have a feeling at all?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I would
like to deal with a person who is able to take responsible
decisions and implement the agreements reached. The name does
not matter. Of course, this person is to have the trust
of the American people, then he or she would not only have
the wish but also the supported political will to implement all
these agreements. </p><p>We have never meddled in the domestic
affairs of any state and we never will. We will keep a close eye
on what is happening and wait for the election results
and after that we will be ready to work with any Administration given
that it wants to work with us.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Can I just
push you on that? Back in 2011 you accused Hillary Clinton
of seeking to trigger the protests that you were facing
in Russia at the time. And by the contrast when
I look at some of things that Donald Trump said about you back
in 2007 that Putin is doing a great job, in 2011 he praised your
no-nonsense way, the next year he said you is new best friend, next year
he said you're outsmarting the Americans, he said you have good ratings
to get … </p><p>And I can go on like that. And you
are really telling me that if you have a choice between a woman, who
you think may've been trying to get rid of you, and a man,
who seems to have this great sort of affection to you, almost
bordering on the homoerotic, you not going to make
a decision between those two, because one of them would seem
to be more favorable towards you?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You know,
actually I have already answered your question, but I can put it
differently, say it in other words: we are ready to deal with any
President, but of course, and I mentioned that, it depends
on the readiness of the future Administration. We always
welcome when somebody says he or she is ready to work with Russia.
But if anybody, just like you said, (inaccurate translation possibly), wants to get
rid of us, then this is a different approach. However, we will get
over it; you never know who is going to lose more with such
an approach. </p><p>Here is the thing: I have seen several times
that anti-Russian cards are being played during domestic campaigns
in the United States. I find this approach very short-sighted. </p><p>At the same time we receive different
signals all around that in fact, everything is fine. The same
situation occurred with the previous administrations during
the election campaigns, claims that everything will be restored later.
I do not think it matches the level of responsibility shouldered
by the United States. I suppose it should be more sound, calm
and balanced.</p><p>As for the criticism we receive, you
know, even Mr. Trump's team criticize us. For instance, one of the participants
or members of his team claimed that Russia was giving money
to the Clintons through some funds and that in fact Russia
is controlling the Clinton family. This is nonsense. I do not
even know where Bill Clinton delivered his speech and I know nothing
about any funds. Both parties simply use it as a tool in their
internal political contention, and I am sure it is a bad thing.
But again, we welcome the fact that somebody expresses readiness to work
with Russia whatever the name of that person.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Very quickly: the other accusation you've faced or heard a lot is people connected with Russia or backed by Russia were the people who
hacked into the Democratic Party database. Is that, you would also say that is
completely untrue?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I know
nothing. There are a lot of hackers today, you know, and they
perform their work in such a filigreed and delicate manner
and they can show their “tracks” anywhere and anytime. It may not
even be a track; they can cover their activity so that it looks like
hackers operating from other territories, from other countries. It is hard
to check this activity, maybe not even possible. Anyway, we do not do that
at the national level.</p><p>Besides, does it really matter who hacked
Mrs. Clinton’s election campaign team database? Does it? What really
matters is the content shown to the community. This is what
the discussion should be held about. There is no need to distract
the attention of the community from the essence
of the subject substituting it with secondary questions dealing with
the search of those who did it.</p><p>I would like to repeat: I know
absolutely nothing about it, and Russia has never done anything like this
at the State level. Frankly speaking, I could never even imagine
that such information would be of interest to the American
public or that the campaign headquarters of one
of the candidates – in this case, Mrs. Clinton –
apparently worked for her, rather than for all the Democratic
Party candidates in an equal manner. I could never assume that
anybody would find it interesting. Thus, in view of what I have
said, we could not officially hack it. You know, it would require certain
intuition and knowledge of the U.S. domestic policy
peculiarities. I am not sure that even our experts from the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs have such intuition.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Do you not
think this is sort of the time when everyone should sort of come
clean about it? Russia tries to hack America, America tries to hack
Russia, China tries to hack America, China tries to hack Russia?
Everyone tries to hack each other. </p><p>One of the purposes of the G-20 is
to come up with a new set of rules so this can become
a more ordered version of foreign policy when everybody is doing
this. Allegedly.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I believe
that the G20 should not interfere, because there are other platforms
for that. The G20 was established as a forum
to discuss, first and foremost, world economic issues. If we load it
with… </p><p>Of course, politics affects economic processes,
this is obvious, but if we bring some squabbles, or not squabbles, rather,
some matters that are really important but relate purely to world
politics, we will overload the G20 agenda and instead
of addressing such issues as finance, structural economic reforms,
tax evasion and so forth, we will engage in endless debates
concerning the Syrian crisis or some other global challenges,
of which there are many, or the Middle East problem. We should
find other platforms, other forums for that, and there are plenty
of them, including, for example, the UN
and the Security Council.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Can I ask one
last question on Donald Trump. Some people say that he is too volatile to be an American president. You would be happy with him as American president in the same way as you would be happy with Hillary Clinton in that role.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We cannot
decide for the American people. After all, despite
the scandalous behavior of one and, by the way,
the other candidate (they are both scandalous in their own ways),
they are smart, they are really smart and they are aware
of the leverages they should use to make the voters
in the United States understand them, feel them and hear them. </p><p>Donald Trump is targeting the traditional
Republican voters, the average person with an average income,
the working class, a certain group of entrepreneurs and those
people who embrace traditional values. </p><p>Mrs. Clinton is focusing on a different
part of the voters trying to influence them in her own way
as well; so they attack each other and in some cases,
I would not want us to follow their pattern. I do not believe
they are setting the best example. But this is the political culture
of the United States, which one should accept as is.
The United States is a great country and it deserves
non-interference and no third-party comments.</p><p>Answering your question for the third time,
I can tell you that we will work with any Administration and with any
President in whom the American people have placed their trust. That
is, of course, if they wish to cooperate with Russia.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Let me ask you
about other country. Another person you'll meet at G-20 Theresa May. Britain
has ended up in the same situation as Russia, it is in Europe, but not, likely
not to be in European Union. Will you approach them with a free-trade deal?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Well,
I would like to finish my answer to the previous
question. You have been working as a journalist for a long
time. You are quite knowledgeable and you understand all the threats
that may arise from a tense international environment, don't you?
Especially if there is tension between major nuclear powers
of the world. We all understand this. </p><p>Of course, you are the one asking me
questions. It is you who is the interviewer, not I. However, let me ask
you a question: do you want another Cuban Missile Crisis? Or don't
you?</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> No, nobody
does.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Of course,
nobody does.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> But that is one
reason why I asked about Donald Trump because he is seen as a more
unpredictable force than Hillary Clinton.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> And you
too would prefer that Russia maintained good relations with both
the United Kingdom and the United States, wouldn't you?
I would prefer it as well. If anybody in the U.S.
or in the United Kingdom says: ”I would like
to establish good partnership relations with Russia“, then both
of us, you and me, should welcome that. So should people like me
and people like you. However, we have no idea yet what would actually
happen after the elections. That is why I am telling you that we will
work with any President designated as such by the American
public.</p><p>As for the United Kingdom, we have
a meeting scheduled with the Prime Minister in China
on the G20 sidelines. We had a telephone conversation.
Unfortunately, the relations between the United Kingdom and Russia
have not developed in the best possible way; however, it has never
been our fault. It was not we who decided to discontinue relations with
the United Kingdom; it was the UK who preferred to ”freeze“ our
bilateral contacts in various fields. If the United Kingdom considers
it necessary to start a dialogue on certain issues, we are ready
for that, we are not going to pout or sulk. We take quite
a pragmatic approach towards cooperation with our partners and we
believe that it would be beneficial for both our countries.</p><p>We were speaking about our largest oil company
Rosneft, and I recalled in the beginning that almost
20 percent of it (19.7) belongs to BP. Who’s company is that?
British Petroleum, isn't it? I suppose that is not bad. I have
to tell you that British Petroleum’s capitalization is significantly
related to the fact that it owns more than 19 percent
of Rosneft, which has vast oil reserves both in Russia
and abroad. This has its impact on the company's stability
as well.</p><p>Thus, BP found itself in a difficult
situation after the tragic events in the Gulf of Mexico. We
did everything we could to support it. Britain is interested in this,
isn't it? I think it is. The same is true of other areas.</p><p>We are marking the anniversary
of the Arctic convoys. You know about that, don't you? We really do
consider members of the Arctic convoy to be heroes. This is
true. I am not saying this as a fashion of speech. Indeed,
that is exactly what they were. We know that the conditions in which
they fought were appalling. Time and again they faced death
in the name of a common victory and we remember that.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Do you think
Britain might be more compliant or more likely to do a deal with Russia now it
is outside or going to leave the European Union?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Britain is
leaving and has de facto left the European Union; however, it has not
withdrawn from its special relationship with the United States
and I believe that the UK's relations with Russia depend
on Britain's special relationship with the United States rather than
on its presence in or absence from the European Union. If
Britain pursues a more independent foreign policy, it might be possible
then. And if it is guided by commitments to its allies and considers
this to be of a bigger national interest than its cooperation
with Russia, so be it. </p><p>After all, this is not our choice; this is
the choice of our British partners, the choice
of priorities. Anyhow, we obviously understand that, being a United
States' ally and having a special relationship with it, the UK
in its relations with Russian has to make an allowance
for the opinion of its partner ‑ the U.S.
We take this reality as a given fact, but let me underscore once
again that we will be ready to do as much as Britain will be
ready to do in order to resume our mutual cooperation. This does
not depend on us.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Can I ask you
about one last person in the G-20. President Erdogan. You didn't protest that
much when Turkish tanks rolled across the Syrian border the other day. Why? Do
you think Turkey has now moved closer to your idea that the future of Syria has
to involve President Assad staying in some way or have you changed your mind
about President Erdogan. A little bit ago you were complaining that you were
stabbed in the back and with the problems to do with the jet being shot down.
Has something changed in Turkey in terms of what you can see?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> First, we proceed from the fact
that Turkey has apologised for that incident and for the death of our people. It
was done in a straightforward manner without any reservations, and we
appreciate this. President Erdogan did so and we see genuine interest of the Turkish President in restoring the country's relations with Russia on a full-scale basis. We share a lot of interests in the Black Sea region, on a global scale and in the Middle East. </p><p>We expect to be
able to begin a constructive dialogue; we have quite a number of major energy
projects, for example, the well-known Turkish Stream. I think we will finally
carry it out, at least its first stage aiming to broaden transportation options
and increase supplies to the Turkish domestic market, but also potentially
providing the European partners with more transportation options if they wish
so and if the European Commission supports this idea.</p><p>We have got a large project to build a nuclear power plant on unique terms and conditions.
They include several components: we extend a loan, we own and we operate. These
unique features give us reasons to believe that this is a feasible project
given the arrangements on economic parameters based on electricity price per
kilowatt-hour, and that this project will be cost-effective for both sides.</p><p>Apart from
other things, though, as I have already said, we share the objective of reaching an agreement on the regional challenges, including the Syrian problem.
I have always believed and continue to believe that no issue related to the change of political regime or change of power should be settled from
outside. </p><p>When I hear
someone say this or that president must resign, and hear that from outside the country rather than from inside, I get a lot of questions. I am pretty
sure and my confidence is based on the events of the last decade, in particular
the attempts to bring democracy to Iraq or Lebanon; we see what they have come
to – virtually to the collapse of statehood and the rise in terrorism. </p><p>Where in Libya
do you see elements of democracy? They might emerge someday, and I really hope they
do. Or take the on-going civil war in Iraq. What is going to happen to Iraq as a state in the future? So far these are just difficult questions.</p><p>Same thing with
Syria. When we hear that Assad must step down (for some reason some people from
outside believe so), I have a question: what will the result be? And in general, is this in line with international law? Where will this lead to? Isn't
it better to remain patient and promote the changes in the structure of the society itself and, by doing so, wait for the changes to happen naturally
within the country. </p><p>Sure, this is
not going to happen overnight, but probably that is what political wisdom is all
about – never to hustle, never to leap ahead but rather to move step by step towards structural changes, in this case in the political system of society.</p><p> As far as Turkey's actions are concerned, we keep contact with our Turkish
partners. We believe that everything that runs counter international law is
unacceptable. But we keep contact on political level, as well as at the level
of the Defence and Foreign Affairs ministries. I am sure we are also going to talk about this during the meeting with Turkish President Erdogan in China.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Very quickly on Syria. Are we any closer to having Russian-American deal about how, a plan for what to happen with Syria. You've had talks recently. It seems that you've got
a little bit closer, but is there any progress on that? And do you think we're
closer to that than we have been?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You know, the negotiation
process is very complicated. One of the main difficulties is that we insist,
and our American partners do not object, that the so-called “healthy part” of the opposition should be separated from the radical groups and terrorist organisations,
such as Jabhat al-Nusra.</p><p>However, we get
a feeling that Jabhat al-Nusra and those of its kind are disguising themselves,
using different names, but nothing changes in essence. They have begun to absorb the “healthy part” of the opposition, and there is nothing good about.
Besides, it is no longerinternal fighting we are facing. Those fighters
have come from abroad supplied with foreign arms and ammunition. Basically, our
American partners agree with this, but they just do not know how to deal with
it. </p><p>Nevertheless,
despite all these difficulties, we are on the right track. I should say that
Secretary of State John Kerry has done tremendous work. It is astonishing how
he manages to be so patient and persistent at the same time. No matter what, I believe we are moving in the right direction, and I do not rule out that, any
time soon, we will be able to reach consensus on some issues and share our
agreements with the global community. It is too early to speak about it, but,
as I have already said, I think we are moving in the right direction.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> If you look
back over all the time you've been president, you could argue the relationship
with the West. All these problems to do with the trust and we can go through
each of the individual conflicts. But when you look back over that period in the way that relationship with west has not always worked , do you think there
are things looking back you would have done differently if you would known
about it?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> No, there is nothing I would
have done differently. I think it is our partners who should have done
many things differently. When the Soviet Union ceased to exist we welcomed our
Western partners with open arms. Just remember what it took us to disclose our
wiretapping systems in the US Embassy in Moscow. Nothing like that was
done in return. You think the CIA does not have any taps listening to us? Of course it does. Moreover, it started working even harder in that respect. </p><p>We, for instance, put an end to the flights of our strategic aviation along the US border, while the United States never did so. We conducted no flights
for ten years, but the United States never stopped, they kept flying. Why? We
said we were ready to create a new system of European security with the participation of the United States. Instead, NATO began to expand, moving
closer to our borders: one step, then another one. </p><p>We said we
needed to address the issues concerning the ABM systems together, preserving or updating the Anti‑Ballistic Missile Treaty. The United States unilaterally
withdrew from the ABM Treaty and launched an intensive construction of anti-ballistic
missile defence system as part of their strategic nuclear forces transferred to the periphery, and started constructing missile deployment areas in Romania
and, subsequently, in Poland. </p><p>Initially, as you remember, it was done with the reference to the Iranian nuclear threat, but
then an agreement with Iran was signed, including by the United States. The agreement has already been ratified, so there is no more threat, however, the construction of the missile deployment areas is still on-going. So the question
is: against whom? Back then we were told, “We are not against you.” We
responded, “But then we will have to modernise our strike systems.” “Do what
you want, we will think it is against somebody else.” So that is what we are
doing. Now, when we have made some progress, our partners have begun to worry, “How
come? What is going on over there?” Why did they give us such an answer back
then? Probably because nobody believed we were capable of doing this. </p><p>In the early
2000s, given the total collapse of Russia's defence industry and, frankly
speaking, low, to put it mildly, low combat capability of the Armed Forces,
nobody could even think that we would manage to regain the combat potential of the Armed Forces and rebuild the national defence industry. We had US observers
(you know this, right?) at our nuclear weapons production facilities. They were
literary there, at the plant; that was the level of trust. And then those moves
followed – first, second, third, fourth. We had to respond somehow, you know.
They keep telling us, “It's none of your business, it doesn't have anything to do with you, it's not against you.”</p><p>Not to mention
a very sensitive period in our history – the traumatic events in the Caucasus
and the Chechen Republic. As a journalist, you should know what was the reaction of the Western political establishment and the media. Did they support
Russia's legitimate authorities in their efforts to restore and strengthen the statehood? No, quite the opposite, they supported separatism, and, in fact,
terrorism. Everybody was turning a deaf ear to the fact that Al-Qaeda was
fighting there, side by side with militants and separatists. They told us, “Do
not worry, we are just concerned about the development of democracy in your
country.” Thank you very much for such care! But still, our attitude is
positive, we understand the logics of political and geopolitical struggle, and we stand ready to cooperate if our partners are ready for such cooperation.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> If I had to look at the West and to sum up where they think, their side of the argument
would be, that they, I think, that the root of their distrust is the idea that
they think that you want to expand Russia's zone of influences, in some case
geographically, but also the very least to control the countries on your
border. And on the moment, the main area of nervousness on that is the Baltics — Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia.
Would you be able to.. You talked about the trust.. Would you be able to say
something that would give them reassurance on that count?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Look, I believe that all
sensible people who are involved in real politics understand that references to threats posed by Russia to, let us say, the Baltic States are absolute
nonsense. Do you think we are going to start a war with NATO? How many people
are there in the NATO countries? About 600 million, right? Russia's
population is 146 million. Yes, we are the largest nuclear power. But do
you really think we are going to use nuclear weapons to take over the Baltics?
Nonsense! That's the first thing, but not the most important one. </p><p>The most
important thing is that we have a vast political experience, and we are
convinced that you cannot do anything against the will of the people. Nothing
can be done against the will of the people! However, it seems that some of our
partners fail to understand this. Thinking of Crimea, they choose not to notice
that the will of the Crimean people, 70 percent of which are ethnic
Russians and the rest speak Russian as their native language, was to join
Russia. They prefer to ignore this. In one place, in Kosovo, the will of the people can be honoured, but here – it cannot. All of this is about
political games.</p><p>So, I can
reassure you that Russia has been pursuing absolutely peaceful foreign policy
aimed at cooperation, and will continue to do so.</p><p>As to extending
our zone of influence, it took me nine hours to get from Moscow to Vladivostok.
It is slightly less than it takes to get from Moscow to New York through the entire Western Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Do you really believe we need any
expansion? It is not territories we are talking about.</p><p>As for the influence,
well, we do want Russia to have stronger and more tangible influence, but we
want it to be absolutely peaceful and positive. What we have in mind is
economic and humanitarian influence, which implies developing equal cooperation
with our neighbours. This is what our foreign policy, as well as our foreign
economic policy, is aimed at. There can be no doubt about it.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> I just want to use one example on the issue. You mentioned Crimea, you mentioned what happened
then and back then in terms of the reassurances as you might give is that back
then March 4th 2014, which is checked, three times our reporter asked you what
is happening inside the Crimea, did you know anything about Russian troops,
which were taking over the Ukrainian government. And you said no, knew nothing
about that nor the military bases. And a year later you talked about directing
operation to bring Crimea home yourself. Do you accept that sometimes you could
may be said things in much clearer way when they are actually happening.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Of course, I do. I have
repeatedly commented on these issues. It is quite simple, and I have already
said that. Indeed, our military personnel were there to ensure security at the voting and referendum. If we had not done so, we would have faced a tragedy
even worse than the one in Odessa when people were burned alive in the House of Trade Unions, when nationalists trapped defenceless and unarmed people inside
the building and burned them alive. Such incidents would have been rampant in Crimea, so we prevented it from happening. The fact is that people came to polling stations to cast a vote voluntarily; no one would have come at gunpoint.</p><p>This is so
obvious, that there can be no doubt about it. Just come over to Crimea, walk around,
and everything will become perfectly clear to you. So, yes, our military
personnel were in Crimea; but they did not even outnumber our grouping that had
been present there under the treaty we had with Ukraine.</p><p>Most
importantly, though, the Crimean parliament, which had been elected two years
prior to the voting under the Ukrainian law, voted in favour of the referendum
and later, in favour of independence. It is an absolutely legitimate
representative body elected by Crimean people. This is first.</p><p>Second, the international legal framework. When the settlement of the Kosovo issue was
under negotiation, the UN International Court of Justice passed a judgment that
was met with applause by all Western partners. The Court decided that the settlement of independence issues did not require the decision of country's
central authorities. So, we did everything in accordance with international
law, the United Nations Charter and principles of democracy, which include,
first of all, the free expression of peoples' will.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> One last set of questions about your legacy or your current achievements. The future.. have you
yet decided if you will run in the presidential elections iof 2018?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> We are having parliamentary elections soon, so
we should wait for results. And even after that, we have almost two more years
to go. So, it is quite premature to talk about it. You know, it is even harmful
to talk about such things today when the world is changing so rapidly. What we
should do is work hard to see accomplished all the plans and targets we have
set. We should achieve the improvement of living standards, economic
development, social wellbeing and national defence capability. Depending on what we will have accomplished on these tracks, we will think about the arrangements for the presidential election campaign in 2018 and who should
participate in it. I have not made my mind yet.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Do you think
Russia is getting easier to run or harder?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Easier than when? In the days of Ivan the Terrible or Nicholas II, or maybe Brezhnev, Khrushchev or Stalin?</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> In your time.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I think it has become harder
because, even though we face harsh criticism coming mainly from our Western
partners, the internal democracy has been developing in our country. For example, there will be much more political parties participating in the upcoming elections than in previous years. This will, undoubtedly, influence
the process and outcomes of election campaigns. </p><p>I mean there is
a practical dimension to it. Now, looking at the rating of the leading Russian
political party – the United Russia – we can see that it has slightly fallen.
So, many people start to question: Is there anything wrong? What happened?
Nothing happened. It is just that an active election campaign has started, so
all these numerous parties participating in the election process appear on the screen, in media, in newspapers.</p><p>What is their
massage? They all criticise the government. They don't offer solutions to make
things better, though. Sometimes they simply say things that even laymen
realize are hardly practicable or just unfeasible. However, they look good on screen, scolding and holding up to shame members of the ruling party. They don't
say whether they are ready to take on responsibility for making unpopular, but
in the long run necessary, decisions.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Are you envious
of the Chinese who don't have to go through these elections?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> China has another political
system, it is a different country. I am sure, you will not be happy to see one
and a half billion people suffering any disruption in their society and government. So, let China have its right and possibility to decide how it
should organise its state and society. Russia is a different country, with
different ways and different level of political system development. It is not
even about the level, it is about the quality of the political system, which is
developing and getting more complicated.</p><p>As a matter of fact, I am happy about it. I want to see this system grow stronger in the future,
to see balance within the political system, so that it could always be
effective and oriented to development.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Would you have
an exit strategy? In 2018 you would have been the longest serving president. Do
you have an idea about how eventually you will leave power?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I either will or will not take
part in the elections. If I do not, another person will be elected head of state, President of Russia. The people will decide for whom they should vote. </p><p>Yet I would
like to underscore that in any case already today we (and by that I mean myself
and the members of my team: the Government Cabinet and the Presidential Administration)
should shape our vision of how the country should develop and what political,
internal political and economic processes should take place. That is why we are
working on a strategy to develop the economy (primarily the economy, certainly)
after 2018. </p><p>I am convinced
that irrespective of the way in which internal political processes develop, we
should offer the country our vision of its economic development. And it will be
up to the next president to agree or disagree with what we have offered, to update it or to offer something completely different.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> You've just
reorganized part of your government, you promoted some people, some former
bodyguards and people like that. Do you think that might be the sort of area
where the next leader for Russia will come? Will it come from the younger
generation of people who are beginning to emerge?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Certainly. I believe that the next Russian leader should be a fairly young yet mature person. </p><p>As for the members of various special services and the Armed Forces, there is nothing new
in what I have done. It has not been the first time when former members of the Defence
Ministry, Federal Security Service have been promoted to head our regions. The Federal Guard Service is no exception; they are just as good as the others. If
a person is willing to develop, is capable of developing, and is ready to serve
his country in an office with greater powers and responsibilities, and I can
see that such person has potential, why not? They can work. </p><p> After
all, regional leaders will also have to go through elections and put forward
proposals for the people of the regions in question to judge. The people in these regions need to look at these programmes, study them, get themselves
familiar with those persons. There should be certain chemistry between the leader of the region and the people that live there. People should feel their
possible new leader and I believe that they have to trust such leader in order
to vote for him or her, otherwise they would not vote.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> People might
say there are two ways in which Russia is very difficult to rule. One is it is
a very personal system, where many people vote for you rather than for party.
And the other reason is Russian is still a fairly lawless place. You have
things like murder of Boris Nemtsov which I know you condemned and you have
brought people in, but the mastermind is still being sought. Is Russia a very
very hard place to govern at the moment?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You know, I may assure you that
it is hard to govern any country. Would you say that governing the United
States is an easy task? Is it easy to address even uncomplicated matters? The Guantanamo detention camp, for example? During his first term President Obama
said that he would shut it down. Yet it is still there. Why? Is it that he does
not want to? Certainly he does. I am sure he does. Yet there emerge thousands
of obstacles that prevent him from resolving this issue. In fact, this is
indeed awful, but that is a different story. It is hard to govern any country,
even a very small one. </p><p>It is not a matter of whether the country is large or small. It is rather a matter of one's
attitude to the task, of whether one takes this task responsibly. </p><p>Russia is also
hard to govern. Yet Russia is at a stage when its political system and market
economy are shaped. It is a complicated yet very intriguing process. Indeed,
Russia is not merely a large country, it is a great country that has distinct
traditions and culture. It is true, it also has distinct political traditions.
It is no secret that we used to have absolute monarchy, then came the times of communist rule, the base somewhat expanded, yet to a certain extent the system
of the government became even more rigid. </p><p>We started
building a completely new multi-party political system only in the 1990s. This
is a very complex process and there are certain stages that cannot be skipped.
Our citizens should get accustomed to this, feel their responsibility when they
arrive at the polling stations. They should learn to question populist
solutions, deliberations or candidates' mutual accusations.</p><p> They
should watch attentively and analyse what candidates have to offer. This
concerns both the parliamentary and presidential elections. By the way, in countries with a presidential form of governance people often vote for the presidential candidate rather than the political party. This is true of virtually any such country, and there is nothing unusual in Russia in this
context.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Surely if you
look at Chechnya and, say, the influence of someone like Ramzan Kadyrov. He has
a very full reign, it does not seem if he is brought under power much. That is
completely different to what would happen in say Mississippi or Tennessee. That
is a different system, what is happening in Chechnya. Surely that is different.
It is more lawless and it is more personal.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> That might be viewed from a different angle. One should not forget that it was not long ago that people
were openly bought and sold on the markets, members of international terrorist
organisations, including Al Qaeda, ruled and people were beheaded in Chechnya.
We by no means have forgotten that. The very Ramzan Kadyrov that is the leader
of Chechnya today fought against the Federal troops during the so-called First
Chechen War. This was a very complex and large transformation, indeed, when
first his father, the first president of Chechnya and then he himself realised
that Chechnya's future was linked to that of Russia. This choice was not a result
of any pressure, but rather their internal conviction. </p><p>I remember
perfectly well my first conversations with Ramzan Kadyrov's father, first
President of Chechnya. He told me bluntly – and at that time,
in 1999, I was the Prime Minister – that ''we see that the future of Chechnya cannot be dissociated from Russia. Otherwise, we will become dependent
on the powerful and therefore we will feel worse. But the most important
thing – which I also remember very well – is that you should
never betray us.''</p><p>It was a very
complex situation back then. The federal centre was behaving
incoherently – either it advanced or retreated, either it agreed with
something or broke agreements afterwards. The Chechen people needed
a consistent and clear position of the country’s central authorities. But
we should not forget the transformations that these people have undergone. We
have signed a treaty with Chechnya and it is fully in line with the Constitution of the Russian Federation. We have a federal state and the federal
constituent entities are granted certain rights, and the example of Chechnya
demonstrates that this does not destroy or ruin the country, but, on the contrary, unites it.</p><p>Of course, many
things require improvement and to a large extent need to forget these tragic
events of the mid-1990s and finally heal our wounds. But all this takes time. </p><p>I am sure
that we will strengthen our internal political institutions and economy and I have no doubts about it. I believe that Russia has already turned
the most tragic pages of its history. We will only go ahead and grow stronger.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> A personal
thing. You've managed to rule Russia for 16 years. If you look at the chief
executives and the business people who tune in to Bloomberg and watch it, very
few of them last longer than 5–6 years, what advice would you give them to hang
on to their jobs for longer?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> No matter how strange it would
sound but one should not cling to power at any price. I have not, as you put
it, just been in power for 16 years, I was the President of the Russian Federation for eight years and after that, without violating the Constitution or readjusting it to my own needs, I just decided not to run
for the third presidential term, which was impossible; within the framework of the current Constitution. Our Constitution stipulates that one can be elected
for two terms running. So I followed the rules: I was elected two
times and then I just left and changed my job – I have worked as the Chairman of the Government for four years. In accordance with the Constitution,
when I regained this right in four years, I run for the presidency,
I was elected and I am the President now. </p><p>So we do not
speak about 16 years, but rather about four and four – that’s eight years, and four
more years now. I have been working as President for 12 years.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> What is the reason for your success?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Wait a minute. As for the time
spent in office, let us say, Canada is one of the examples. I believe that its
leader has spent 16 years in power. And the German Chancellor, for how
much time has she stayed in power? If we refer to the number one in the executive power.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Not 16 years.
You have done longer than most.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I have not been President for 16 years, but for 12 years. I suppose that she has been in power not
for fewer years. </p><p>But this is not
about it. I do not know what secrets can exist here. I do not have any secrets.
I just always try to feel the spirits of the people, feel their needs, their
mood for patterns and methods of solving the tasks, their priorities, and I am
guided by all this in the first place. I believe that it is the most important
aspect in the job of any person who does the kind of work that the Russian
people have entrusted me with.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> You look around
the world at the moment. There are so many countries that become dynasties —
the Clintons, the Bushes in America. You have children who you successfully
kept out of the public eye. Would you ever want your daughters to go into
politics? Would want them to have the same life as you?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I do not regard that I have
the right to wish something for them. They are young, but nevertheless they are
adults and should determine their future by themselves. In general, as I see it, they have already chosen their way, they pursue science and they
are engaged in some activities that are noble and needed by people. They feel
in demand, they enjoy their work and I am happy about it. They are responsible
and honest about the profession they have chosen for themselves.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> When I flew
here on Korean airlines I had a choice of two films to watch: one was Doctor
Zhivago, and the other was the Godfather. Which would you recommend to somebody
trying to understand Russia?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I do not know. You see, we have
a famous poem, which goes: “You will not grasp her with your mind or cover with
a common label, for Russia is one of a kind – believe in her, if you are
able.” </p><p>But the Russian
culture is multifaceted and diverse. That is why if you want to understand, to feel Russia, you should certainly read books – Tolstoy, Chekhov, Gogol, Turgenev –
listen to Tchaikovsky's music and watch our classical ballet. But the most
important thing that one should do is talk to people. I assure you: as soon as you start to meet average ordinary people you will understand that
Russians, whether they are Tatars, Mordovians, Chechens, Daghestanis, are very
open-hearted people. They are open and a bit naive.</p><p>But there is
one characteristic feature, which many nations must have but it is particularly
evident in Russians. It is a pursuit of justice. It seems to me that it is one
of the dominant features in the Russian mentality. And another component of the Russian mentality is a pursuit of some [ideals]… Of course, this is a common
feature, there are millions of people and all people are different from each
other, but on the average we certainly want to be well off and I will strive to do my best for people to live better and to improve their living standards.
Notwithstanding all this, there is a pursuit of some high moral ideal, some
moral values in Russian people's mentality and heart. This is the thing that
for sure – and I am convinced of it – is our positive distinctive
feature.</p><p><b>John Micklethwait:</b> Ok then, that
sounds like Doctor Zhivago to me.</p><p>President
Putin, I thank you for talking to us. You were so generous to devote your time
to us.</p><p> <b>Vladimir Putin:</b>
Thank you very much. </p> <div class="read__bottommeta hidden-copy"> <div class="width_limiter">                 <div class="read__status masha-ignore"> <div class="width_limiter"> <h3>Publication
