are on the rise, having increased by 2.6 percent. Consumer demand growth has
been apparent. This is a positive factor. After a lengthy interval, the population’s real income has shown some, albeit very moderate, growth. According
to the latest statistics, real incomes will increase by 0.5 percent. I hope
that this momentum will be maintained, since real pay levels are on the rise, having
grown by 7.4 percent in the first nine months, which is expected to give us 6.9
or 7 percent by the end of the year.</p><p>Inflation remains at an acceptable level,
although it has increased a little in the past week, by 0.5 percent, I think.
Therefore, we will be able to reach the Central Bank’s reference rate of 4
percent and will have an inflation rate of 4.1 percent to 4.2 percent – somewhere
just over 4 percent. </p><p>The unemployment rate is going down, which is
good news. If last year it hit a historical low of 5.2 percent, this year it will
be even lower – 4.8 percent.</p><p>The trade balance surplus is growing. In 2017,
if you remember, it was around $115 billion. Over the three quarters of this
year we already achieved $157 million. As of the end of the year, we expect it
to reach $190 billion.</p><p>Our finances are growing stronger. Our gold and foreign currency reserves have grown by over 7 percent. In the early 2018, they
amounted to $432 billion while now they stand at almost $464 billion.</p><p>For the first time since 2011, we will have a budget surplus. We are about to reach the federal budget surplus of 2.1 percent
of the GDP. The National Welfare Fund has grown by around 22 percent.</p><p>The average annual insurance component of the retirement pension stood at 13,677 rubles in 2017. By the end of this year, it
will be 14,163 rubles.</p><p>Life expectancy has also increased slightly compared
to 2017, from 72.7 to 72.9 years.</p><p>These are the general results that I wanted to mention in the beginning. Let’s not waste our time and proceed to your
questions and my attempts to answer them.</p><p><b>Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry
Peskov:</b> Let us begin by giving some priority to the Kremlin pool. Its members
worked with us throughout the year, following the President both in Russia and abroad.</p><p>ITAR-TASS,
the state news agency.</p><p><b>Veronika Romanenkova:</b> Thank you.</p><p>The year 2018 arguably went by under
the sign of new national projects that you launched with the May Executive
Order. They are expected to cost an enormous amount of money. However, some experts,
members of the State Council, as was mentioned in Yalta only recently, have
questioned the feasibility of these national projects and whether they are
needed. How well thought out are the performance assessment criteria for the national projects? For example, the Accounts Chamber Chairman said that there
is no way to assess their effectiveness. What can you say to counter this?</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/wMOKBG3gooEURFjcL9GZh9W0UQ7wKd1j.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/v7dNiARjlgR8PAmYlwGlcMSIcbDtjAA0.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(45, 48, 55);background:linear-gradient(0deg, #2d3037 0%, rgba(45,48,55,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #4580f6 0%, rgba(69,128,246,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #c8d0d8 0%, rgba(200,208,216,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #946a5f 0%, rgba(148,106,95,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I will have to begin by saying a few words on whether these projects
are needed, since you said that some question this.</p><p>I have said it on numerous
occasions, and I will repeat it today. We need a breakthrough. We need to transition to a new technological paradigm. Without it, the country has no
future. This is a matter of principle, and we have to be clear on this.</p><p>How can this be done? We need to focus the available resources, find and channel them to the essential
development initiatives. How can these efforts be organised? By simply
distributing money, and that’s it? </p><p>First, we had to find this money. It
took us the entire year 2017 to articulate the objectives and find the resources. Both the Government and the Presidential Executive Office contributed
to this effort. By the way, when some call for more changes within the Cabinet,
we have to understand that it was the Government’s financial and economic block
that developed the national development programme to 2024. For this reason,
they are the ones who must take responsibility for the plans they made. There
is no way around it.</p><p>So how should this effort be
organised? By simply distributing money? After all, as much as 20.8 trillion
rubles are expected to go into the national projects alone, and another 6.5
trillion will be invested in a separate infrastructure development plan. Of course, the allocation of these resources has to be set forth in documents of some kind on achieving breakthroughs. You can refer to these development plans
any way you wish. We call them national projects. After all, it makes it clear
that there are goals that have to be achieved. If there are no objectives, you
will never achieve the final outcome, no matter how you manage these
investments. It is for this reason that the 12 national projects were developed
alongside an infrastructure development plan. Let me remind you of the main
vectors.</p><p>Healthcare, education, research and human capital come first, since without them there is no way a breakthrough can
be achieved. The second vector deals with manufacturing and the economy. Of course, everything is related to the economy, including the first part. But the second part is directly linked to the economy, since it deals with the digital
economy, robotics, etc. I have already mentioned infrastructure.</p><p>Why did we have this meeting in Yalta, Crimea, to discuss with our colleagues from the Government and the regions how we will proceed in these efforts? Because there are questions on how to assess performance under these projects. We need effective controls,
while making sure that all efforts by the federal centre to monitor what is happening in the regions are effective. It is
true that there are challenges in this regard, but we are working on them. So
what is the tricky part? The tricky part is that funding mostly comes from the federal centre, and this applies to all programmes, while most of the efforts
are undertaken in the regions. The regions must be ready to work
constructively. Instead of simply hiking up prices in response to an increase
in the available funds, they must focus on achieving concrete results that will
be clearly visible. This is the first point I wanted to make.</p><p>Second, we need to understand
whether they will be able to succeed. This is a real question. Some argue that
this would be impossible. But this is what we hear from those who must deliver.
Instead of having these thoughts they need to work on delivering on these
objectives, and if they feel that they are unable to do so, they have to clear
the way for those who are positive about their ability to deliver and are ready
to work. To tell you the truth, I have not seen anyone who did not want to do
it or said that it was impossible. These messages come from outside observers.</p><p>Without ambitious goals we will
never achieve anything. For this reason, I do hope that the federal centre and the regions will be able to work together in a consolidated and positive manner.
Yes, some indicators have to be adjusted. Our colleagues from the regions have
submitted their proposals to this effect, and I have high hopes that the Government will take them into consideration and adjust specific indicators so
that we can move forward effectively.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/EcFYb6IG4aUEQktDA4JTPn98xAfpVt7N.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/exdwJ9UDcdp8srQXooYQ2APXtoi6wn98.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(112, 133, 164);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #7085a4 0%, rgba(112,133,164,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #1e4af0 0%, rgba(30,74,240,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #eb602f 0%, rgba(235,96,47,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #502714 0%, rgba(80,39,20,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
Rossiya TV channel.</p><p>I would like to expand on a topic
that has already been raised. Many economics experts, including Alexei Kudrin, assert
that in reality, the Russian economy has been growing just by one percent on average over the past ten years, and if so, this is essentially marking time, or stagnation. You set the goal of making a breakthrough, a leap, but for this,
even if we take the lowest estimate, the growth rate should be at least four to five times higher. The Government promises to achieve the goal, but that same
Government acknowledges that in the next few years, GDP growth rates will not
exceed even 2 percent. In this regard, here are my questions: what does the Government rely on in its forecasts, in the planning of its work? Is a breakthrough possible at all, in this context, or will the economy continue operating
like this: we make some money on oil surplus, put it aside, then spend it when there
is a need for it? In general, are you satisfied with the Medvedev team?</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b>
Friends, I would ask you please to respect each other – ask only one question
each.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Look, economic growth has been one percent per year for a certain period of time. But, first of all, it was while Mr Kudrin was Deputy Prime Minister, so you
must not blame the mirror for showing a crooked face, as they say. This is the first point.</p><p>The second is, one should not just
count mechanically. I have great respect for Mr Kudrin, he is my friend and a good professional, and as a rule, I listen to his recommendations. He is a reliable specialist, a good one. But look, from 2008 to 2018, the economy grew
by about 7.4 percent. In simple maths – yes, it equals one percent, a little
more. However, let us not forget how the economy developed. There were higher
growth rates, alternating with recessions associated with the global crisis. In 2009, after the crisis in the global economy, not in ours – Russia was not the cause of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, it came to us from the outside – the decline was about 7.8 percent. Then little by little, we were
crawling out of it for many years.</p><p>Then, in 2014–2015, another meltdown
occurred – a collapse in the oil prices, our main exports. That is why I am
saying we should not simply count mechanically.</p><p>However, of course, the country's
GDP, the GDP growth rate is one of the main indicators. But we will not be able
to achieve the GDP growth rates necessary for this breakthrough unless the structure of the economy is changed. This is what the national projects are
aimed at, and why such enormous funds will be invested, which I have already
said – to change the structure and build an innovation-based economy. The Government is counting on this, because if this happens, and we should all work
towards this, then the growth rates will increase and there will be other
opportunities for development.</p><p>By the way, you mentioned the projected 2 percent growth for the next two years. Yes, in the next years,
2019–2020, two percent each, but from 2021, the Government is already planning 3
percent, and then more. Therefore, I strongly hope that we will manage to do
all this. Some fluctuations are probably possible, but, I repeat, the most important
thing is that we need… Do you see what we need to do? We need to join another
league of economies, and not only in terms of volumes. I think that taking the fifth place in terms of volume is quite possible. We used to rank fifth in terms of the economy, in purchasing power parity, and we will do it again, I think. However, we need to ascend to another league in terms of the quality of the economy. This is what our national projects are aimed at.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
Are you satisfied with the Medvedev team?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> Overall, yes.</p><p><b>Question:</b> Good afternoon.</p><p>Mr President, in my city of Volgograd we had a wonderful year. We celebrated the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Battle of Stalingrad. You made it a federal holiday and we really appreciate it. You also

region indeed began to breathe and develop.</p><p>There is a lot that still needs to be done. I think the economy will be extensively discussed. But Volgograd residents have a big wish and a great favour to ask. In 1998, the Kacha Higher Military Aviation
School of Pilots, which had a very long history, was shut down.</p><p>It was established at the Tsar’s decree in 1910
and we were truly proud of it and want to be proud of it further. We want the military traditions to live on. Please consider re-opening it.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> In which year was it shut down?</p><p><b>Remark:</b> In 1998, unfortunately. It had the Order of the Red Banner and a long history.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You see, it is already 2018. It
happened 20 years ago and I do not quite know what is left of this legendary
school.</p><p>You are right, it was indeed a legendary
school. But the Russian Defence Ministry plans personnel training resources
based on whether there is a demand for specific types of personnel in the Armed
Forces.</p><p>Therefore, we need to look at what can be done
not only to remember it but perhaps to preserve the remaining traditions. I will make sure to look into this and consult with the Defence Ministry.</p><p><b>Maria Balyuk:</b> Mr President, good afternoon. My name is Maria Balyuk, I represent the Prime news agency.</p><p>Mr President, the budget in the current year
and the next year will have a surplus. However, starting January 1, a number of decisions are coming into effect that may cause a significant increase in prices
of a wide range of goods and services.</p><p>For example, the VAT will increase to 20
percent, which has already triggered a two-stage increase in the housing and utilities rates next year. There is also the new tax for self-employed persons
in pilot regions. Please tell us how these measures agree with the state’s
economic policy.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Housing and utilities rates in two
stages, and what else?</p><p><b>Maria Balyuk:</b> And, for example, a tax on self-employed people in pilot regions.</p><p>Isn’t this amount of new measures too much of a burden on Russians and the economy?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You said about the surplus.</p><p>Yes, this is indeed a good indicator of the Government’s economic block performance. As I said in my opening remarks, for the first time since 2011 we will have a budget surplus of 2.1 percent. And this is good.</p><p>Let us not forget that as an oil producing
country and a country that derives much of its revenue from selling oil and gas, we also have what is called a non-oil-and-gas deficit. This is what the country earns from selling products and services other than oil and gas.</p><p>Let me remind you that this non-oil-and-gas
deficit was 13 percent in 2009, which is a lot. In the early 2000s, it was at about 3 percent, but the global economic crisis forced us to use our oil
revenues to meet our social commitments and finance the Armed Forces, so we had
to tap into the oil revenues.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/TLyOpjAYLtFuy6ySAK2IqKZa0ml8AaaS.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/4JD222SAFGmhbMLZ0GmelBtD4zV9DHoR.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(46, 48, 59);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #2e303b 0%, rgba(46,48,59,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #808ea0 0%, rgba(128,142,160,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #466887 0%, rgba(70,104,135,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #d8daca 0%, rgba(216,218,202,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p>In this situation, the non-oil-and-gas deficit
surged into the double digits almost reaching13 percent, I believe. This was a very serious challenge for the Russian economy. We have now reduced it to 6.6
percent, and next year it is expected to decline to 6 percent and remain at this level for the next few years.</p><p>This is a very important indicator of economic
resilience for the Russian Federation. Therefore, the increase in the VAT rate,
among other things, is due to the need to maintain the non-oil-and-gas deficit
at a certain level.</p><p>Second, in many countries VAT is 20 percent or even higher. It used to be higher in Russia as well, but we reduced it at a certain point. Now we have returned to a 20-percent tax rate.</p><p>However, the effective VAT rate for the overall
economy will be below 20 percent since almost all benefits remain in place: for pharmaceuticals, children’s goods, and so on, including for IT companies. Many
benefits have been preserved. With this in mind, the effective rate will be
actually lower.</p><p>Finally, I do hope that the rate hike will be
only a one-off measure with a possible slight increase in prices and inflation
in the beginning of the year, after which the inflation will go down.</p><p>The Central Bank also seeks to prevent
inflation from picking up. Only recently, the interest rate was increased by 0.25 percentage points.</p><p>While there are definitely both benefits and disadvantages to this decision, all this is done in order to prevent inflation
and prices from growing. For this reason, I believe that the overall decision
was correct and balanced, creating additional budget revenue and the possibility to deliver on our development plans as part of the national
projects.</p><p>As for increases in housing and utilities
tariffs, over the past years they grew by about 4 percent per year. It is true
that next year there will be two hikes: the first one will be at about 1.7
percent, and the second one I think will be about 2.4 percent, but in total
this still makes up 4.1 percent.</p><p>Why will the increase be spread out in two
stages? The reason is that with a higher VAT, prices of some goods and services
are expected to increase, and we need to make sure that the utilities sector
does not come under stress.</p><p>For this reason, in order to shield companies in this sector from these developments and ultimately in the interests of the people, we decided to proceed in two stages. That said, the overall increase
should not exceed 4.1 percent.</p><p> In some regions, where the utilities infrastructure
requires major upgrades and bigger hikes are required, this can be done as an exception, and subject to federal Government approval.</p><p><b>Yekaterina Gagarina:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President. My name is Yekaterina Gagarina. I represent the Rossiya TV channel in Novosibirsk.</p><p>The importance of the Akademgorodok 2.0 [Academic Town] project that you supported during your visit
to Novosibirsk is obvious not only to Siberian scientists. This project is
unique for the entire country.</p><p>But behind the technological component of this project there are a number of tasks of a similarly large scale. They include building housing, roads, kindergartens and schools. My question is what if our scientific ambitions crash at daily living
problems? Will the scientists have somewhere to live?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I would not want them to crash.</p><p>I understand that it is
a very important part of the entire process. Of course, we will be working on this with the regional officials. When I visited Novosibirsk, I also spoke
about this with my colleagues.</p><p>The first objective of the federal government is to honour its obligations related to the facilities which
trigger the development of Akademgorodok – which, by the way, is the opportunity to earn money on these high technologies. The social component will
definitely be carried out after this.</p><p>But if any additional
action is required to resolve the scientists’ social issues, of course, we will
try to do it. By the way, the mortgage sector has been growing lately. We will
support it as well. It is growing very fast for everybody.

Sergei Marov, Zvezda newspaper, Volgograd Region. I will start with small
details and bring you to the bigger question.</p><p>I will give you a simple
example. Next to our editorial office, there is a company which for nine years…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> A company?</p><p><b>Sergei Marov:</b> Yes.</p><p>For nine years, it has
been putting gigantic efforts into building a technological chain for full-cycle flax processing. Imagine…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Excuse me, for the full cycle of processing…</p><p><b>Sergei Marov:</b> Flax.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I see.</p><p><b>Sergei Marov:</b> From planting a seed to finished
clothing. This is what they did.</p><p>It appears that the message from these industrial workers is clear. At the same time, when I was
going to this conference, I had serious consultations with the company’s
workers, and they said: “The last research institute dealing with flax is in the process of liquidation.”</p><p>The last training
institute for executive personnel in the fibre flax cultivation is in the process of liquidation. We are receiving completely different messages from the industrial companies working on the product and from the government that is
supposed to support these industries.</p><p>Therefore, I have a question. How do you assess the state of industrial production and its growth
rate? Do you believe that at this stage the government provides sufficient support
to Russian producers?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Frankly speaking, I am not aware of the problems of this flax research institute. But in general, flax is one of Russia’s traditional industries. It has always been our signature product, our
pride. I will look into this situation.</p><p>Usually the problem is worse than it appears from the outside. I just do
not know the details of what is going on with that institute – although, of course, flax production, once again, has always been Russia’s pride. If the industry needs this institute, it may be preserved, but we need to understand
how this can be done. I promise you to look into this.</p><p>Now over to industrial production. As I said, industrial growth in general is ahead of GDP growth at 3 percent. The processing industry has grown by 3.2 percent. This is a good performance indicator.</p><p>As concerns light industry, it is developing even faster. Over the ten
months of this year, food production has grown by 13 percent, which is, by the way, confirmed by the consumption figures that are generally growing. Clothing
and footwear industries posted a growth of 9 percent, a very good result.</p><p>Now, is government support sufficient or not? It is not. This is why we
have mapped out a number of programmes to support specific production sectors.
Overall, by 2024, this support will amount to 1.376 trillion rubles and will extend
to the light industry, aviation, the defence industry and some other sectors.</p><p> We have individual programmes for major industries.
Next year, they will receive 450 billion rubles in support. The year after, it
will be 450 to 470 billion rubles. These are the indicators, the figures. The total funding stands at 1.376 trillion rubles.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/u9SIRBhWDiAz5ZyxwsAgrXStydPvyiAk.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/EAF7d8sGap2heO1PNJLrWvGOU6jDqm70.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(37, 40, 55);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #252837 0%, rgba(37,40,55,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #434c5e 0%, rgba(67,76,94,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #50749f 0%, rgba(80,116,159,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #a07f76 0%, rgba(160,127,118,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Anton Vernitsky:</b> Mr President, as Soviet-era children, all of us feared a nuclear war
very much. As you remember, various songs dealt with this issue. One of them
had the following lyrics: “Sunny world: Yes, yes, yes; nuclear explosion: No,
no, no.”</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Are you not afraid today? </p><p><b>Anton Vernitsky:</b> Forty years have passed, and major media outlets on both sides of the ocean are beginning to publish a scenario for a nuclear exchange between Russia
and the United States. The word “war” is sounding more and more often at household level, in kitchens. </p><p>Mr President, how can you calm down
my little son who, just like me, also fears a nuclear war today? What words and actions can calm us all down?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You know, I think you are right. </p><p>I just thought that all this,
including the danger of such developments in the world, is now being hushed up
and played down to some extent. It seems impossible or something that is not so
important. At the same time, if, God forbid, something like this happens, it
might destroy the whole of civilisation or perhaps the entire planet.</p><p>These issues are therefore serious,
and it is a great pity that there is such a tendency to underestimate the problem, and that this tendency is probably becoming more pronounced. What are
the current distinguishing features and dangers?</p><p>First, all of us are now witnessing
the disintegration of the international system for arms control and for deterring the arms race. This process is taking place after the United States
withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty that, as I have already
noted a thousand times, was the cornerstone in the sphere of non-proliferation
of nuclear weapons and deterring the arms race.</p><p>After that, we were forced to respond by developing new weapons systems that could breach these ABM systems. Now,
we hear that Russia has gained an advantage. Yes, this is true. So far, the world has no such weapons systems. Leading powers will develop them, but, as yet they do not exist.</p><p>In this sense, there are certain
advantages. But, speaking of the entire strategic balance, this is just an element of deterrence and for equalising parities. This is just the preservation of parity, and nothing more.</p><p>They are now about to take another
step and withdraw from the INF Treaty. What will happen? It is very difficult
to imagine how the situation will unfold. What if these missiles show up in Europe? What are we supposed to do then?</p><p>Of course, we will need to take some
steps to ensure our safety. And they should not whine later that we are allegedly
trying to gain certain advantages. We are not. We are simply trying to maintain
the balance and ensure our security.</p><p>The same goes for the START III
Treaty, which expires in 2021. There are no talks on this issue. Is it because
no one is interested, or believes it is necessary? Fine, we can live with that.</p><p>We will ensure our security. We know
how to do it. But in general, for humanity, this is very bad, because this
takes us to a very dangerous line.</p><p>Finally, there is another
circumstance I cannot ignore. There is a trend to lower the threshold for the use
of nuclear weapons. There are plans to create low-impact nuclear charges, which
translates to tactical rather than global use. Such ideas are coming from Western
analysts who say it is okay to use such weapons. However, lowering the threshold can lead to a global nuclear disaster. This is one danger we are
facing today.</p><p>The second is the use of non-nuclear
ballistic missiles. True, our US partners seem to have dropped this idea, but
it still exists. What does it mean?</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/LYqmb9p2YkB24uAAK2AiIvfxQwvC4Em8.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/jbvIMF7giAwjl4CUJ3GKh2lChHSg7nCu.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(100, 112, 130);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #647082 0%, rgba(100,112,130,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #0a101c 0%, rgba(10,16,28,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #99d0e6 0%, rgba(153,208,230,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #2b3bfd 0%, rgba(43,59,253,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Before the beginning of Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p>Suppose, a ballistic missile is launched,
nuclear or non-nuclear. The missile attack warning system identifies the launch
and the launch site, and, seconds later, determines the flight path and the possible warhead landing area. This is all on the verge of a possible error. It
is terrible, and we cannot take it that far. Nevertheless, such an idea of using
non-nuclear ballistic missiles exists.</p><p>Suppose, a submarine fired a ballistic missile from the World Ocean, but who the hell knows if it is nuclear
or not, go figure. This is very dangerous. All of that is being widely discussed,
which is dangerous.</p><p> However, I believe humanity has enough common sense
and enough of a sense of self-preservation not to take these things to the extreme.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov</b>:
Let us go to this sector. I see the Ukrainian flag in the second row.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
You attend all our news conferences, correct? You are from Ukraine?</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov</b>:
Yes, he is our colleague from Ukraine.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Right, my colleagues told me it was better not to let him speak, because he would
cause a scandal. Are you going to cause a scandal now?</p><p>Please go ahead.</p><p><b>Yegor Sozayev-Guryev</b>: Yegor Sozayev-Guryev, Izvestia. My question is about the incident in the Kerch Strait.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
But Izvestia is not from Ukraine, is it?</p><p><b>Yegor Sozayev-Guryev</b>: Well, my question is about Ukraine.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Well, go ahead.</p><p><b>Yegor Sozayev-Guryev</b>: I have a question about the precedent in the Kerch Strait, I wonder
about the future of the captured Ukrainian military. What will happen to them?
Do you think this provocation was a success?</p><p>I cannot help asking about the citizens of Russia imprisoned in the United States. I mean Butina and Yaroshenko. How can Russia protect their rights? Perhaps, we should look at our
Chinese partners? A Chinese citizen representing Huawei was detained in Canada.
In response, they detained several Canadian citizens. Perhaps, we could learn
from that experience?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
With regard to your first question, you said: “Do you think this provocation
was a success?” First, let us state that it was a provocation, and you agree
with that. This is already a good start.</p><p>Now, whether it was a success or not,
I believe provocations are a bad thing whatever way you look at them. Provocations
seek to aggravate things. Why do our Ukrainian partners need things to go that
way? Clearly, they are in the middle of an election campaign right now, and they
want to aggravate the situation in order to raise the ratings of one of the contenders, I mean the incumbent president and the current government. Well,
this is bad, it is ultimately bad for the interests of the Ukrainian people and state. However, it is possible to move forward without any provocations and do
so calmly, as before.</p><p>Whether it was a success or not, I mean in terms of improving popularity ratings, maybe it was, as Mr Poroshenko’s
ratings seem to have increased a little and he has moved from the fifth
position to the second or third, where the figure fluctuates around 12 percent. Ms Tymoshenko, I believe, has
20 percent or even more, whereas Zelinsky, Boyko and Poroshenko have around 12
percent each. In this sense, yes, he probably achieved the goal. At the expense
of the country’s interests, I believe. This is a bad way to boost ratings.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/X33FJwU4wT47WQf4AyRz7GFAXPkW6MLF.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/y1ZuB2Wb1ejN8gsUlhpkPUaMcGAV9yZw.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(6, 104, 254);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #0668fe 0%, rgba(6,104,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #361d2b 0%, rgba(54,29,43,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #b69681 0%, rgba(182,150,129,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #e0f0f8 0%, rgba(224,240,248,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p>With regard to the future of the Ukrainian servicemen, they were sent on this mission and some of them were

expected some of them to die. Thank God, this did not happen. An investigation
is underway. Once it is over, we will know what to do with them.</p><p> Still, I will ask you to give the microphone to our

scandal. There never was a scandal actually. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Thank God.That already is good news.</p><p><b>Roman Tsymbalyuk:</b> Mr President, I would like to ask
you how much money you are spending on the occupied Donbass? Under your leadership,
people there are living in poverty. Let us face it, they have become slaves to Russia.
You are concerned about the threat of a nuclear war and at the same time, you
are preparing for a war against NATO, and, in fact, you are shooting at Ukrainian citizens. It was you as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief who issued the order to open fire at seamen. My question is what are the terms of the exchange? </p><p>And a question about the elections, if I may. You say that you analyse
the approval ratings.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Just a second. Terms of exchange? </p><p><b>Roman Tsymbalyuk:</b> The terms of exchange of Ukrainian
political prisoners and Ukrainian servicemen. You do need your Russian citizens
back, don’t you?</p><p>And about the elections, if I may. You constantly analyse the ratings
and one gets the impression that…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I do not analyse them, I look at them inasmuch as you print them. </p><p><b>Roman Tsymbalyuk: …</b> in this way you are meddling in the electoral process like you did in the United States. Doesn’t it seem to you
that a direct dialogue between the presidents of Ukraine and Russia will never
take place until you change your job?</p><p>Thank you. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Regarding the suffering of the people who live in Donbass. You are a Ukrainian citizen, aren’t you? And you
consider the people who live on this territory to be the citizens of your
country. Can you tell me who established the blockade between Donbass and the rest of Ukraine? Did Russia do it? The Ukrainian authorities did it: they
imposed a total economic blockade of the territory they consider to be their
own. They shoot at the people they consider to be their own citizens. People
are killed there almost every day, peaceful civilians, by the way. </p><p>We do render humanitarian and other assistance and support to the people
who live on that territory. But we do it only to prevent them from being
finally crushed, devoured and torn to pieces, and we will continue doing it.
Because attempts to solve these political issues by force – and we have seen
this being done by the current Kiev authorities for several years – are doomed
to failure. This has to be kept in mind.</p><p>Now concerning how to settle these relations and who will and will not
remain in power. It is not about personalities, it is about the attitude towards
people. We want to see peace and prosperity on the entire territory of Ukraine,
including Donbass. We are interested in it because Ukraine remains one of our
biggest trade and economic partners. </p><p>Trade between Ukraine and Russia, in spite of all the efforts of the current Kiev authorities, is growing, it has grown in the outgoing year, it has
grown during the current year. Is it strange? No, it is not strange because
these are natural ties. These natural ties will sooner or later make themselves
felt. But as long as the Kiev corridors of power are peopled by Russophobes who
do not understand the interests of their own people this abnormal situation
will persist. Regardless of who is in power at the Kremlin. </p><p>We have attended to the issue of exchange all along. Mr Medvedchuk, on instructions from Poroshenko, by the way, has been constantly engaged in this.
He came to Moscow just recently and raised the issue of the release of Ukrainian servicemen detained in the Kerch Strait, in the Black Sea to be more
precise. Yes, Medvedchuk raised this issue. However, as I have said, these
issues could only be tackled after the criminal case is closed.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/dlm37oAJ6nUwxNlj5zEpKMmnUL3SLADB.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/xcclCvoAyNVXenUfsTcetySRPf1tkAAi.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(168, 175, 189);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #a8afbd 0%, rgba(168,175,189,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #332119 0%, rgba(51,33,25,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #a0846c 0%, rgba(160,132,108,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #5a463d 0%, rgba(90,70,61,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Margarita Baulina</b>: Good afternoon, colleagues, Mr

and information work are all the same. At the end of the day, they are all
about information: you work with information, and so do the special services.</p><p><b>Kseniya Golovanova:</b> Russian society, especially its younger part, have recently witnessed
strange actions by the authorities that I believe can cause unnecessary conflict.
One example is the case of the rappers – I think you are already familiar with
this word. They come under pressure, with crackdowns on their concerts.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Are you questioning my competency?</p><p><b>Kseniya Golovanova:</b> Not at all.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You said, “I think you are already familiar with this word.” Well, I knew it even before.</p><p><b>Kseniya Golovanova:</b> Well, you tend to use it more often now.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> There were rappers among my authorised representatives. Take Timati,
for example. Just look at this spectacular guy. By the way, he is a wonderful
person and a brilliant artist.</p><p><b>Kseniya Golovanova:</b> During the meeting of the Council for Culture, you said that if you
cannot rein in a movement, you have to become its leader. Could you tell me why
the state has to have a role in all this? Why not just leave it alone? Why did the people have to be dispersed? Who needed it? So they use obscene language in their songs – let them be.</p><p>There is a second question I wanted
to ask that also deals with young people. A lot of people have recently voiced
their misgivings over a legislative initiative on introducing tighter
responsibility for negative statements regarding the state and authorities.
This will also primarily target young people on social media. Aren’t you afraid
that these initiatives could cost you their support?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Let me start with the question on alienating young people or attracting
them.</p><p>You know, in any discussion about
the youth, I always remember ceratin tragic and heroic chapters from our recent
past. Do you remember the airborne squadron of 96 young lads, 19 or 20 years
old, who found themselves in the Armed Forces almost immediately after
graduating from school? These 96 soldiers fought against 2,000. Only six
survived. They fought for almost three days, at times fighting at close
quarters, with shovels and knives. They are heroes, and they were young, 19 or 20 years old <i>(Applause).</i></p><p>Take volunteers, for example. There
are thousands and thousands of them. I think that as many as 35,000 worked at the World Cup. And what about those involved in battlefield archaeology? There
are thousands of them as well. They are all young people.</p><p>People of this kind form a very
substantial social stratum, a large social group. They are all young, they are
the foundation of Russia’s present and future. There are also young
researchers, talented artists and musicians, including rappers.</p><p>As for responsibility for desecration
of the flag or other state symbols, it exists in almost every country. People
must respect their country. There are rules that must be respected everywhere.
If there is responsibility offline, it must also exist online.</p><p>In what way does online behaviour
differ from offline activity? After all, these are still social interactions,
especially since the internet has penetrated all areas of our lives. For this
reason, there is nothing extraordinary about it.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/17bzVuOcUzeAq3A5WdP2zhjkjMPAceOc.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/jm4fNXOvKalkRskJc2SSRLEkjPNYek6y.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(3, 106, 254);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #036afe 0%, rgba(3,106,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #85867c 0%, rgba(133,134,124,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #4d302b 0%, rgba(77,48,43,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #acf2fb 0%, rgba(172,242,251,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p> As for these rappers being detained, I agree with
you. This does not make any sense and brings about the opposite effect to what
was intended, leading nowhere. That being said, there is nothing good in what
you said about letting people use obscene language and not paying attention to it.</p><p>Recently, as you must have seen, I attended
Yury Temirkanov’s birthday celebration; he turned 80. He said something very
common and still absolutely correct: “Art does not exist to indulge base
motives, base interests and low cultural profile. Culture is there to raise the level of those things.”</p><p>Of course, this is not something people should
be caught, restricted or punished for. This would be wrong. But there are other
things. For example, remember, I did not know it was broadcast live, where I told my interlocutor: “Let us all use foul language here at the Council on Culture meeting.” Everyone laughed. Why? It never occurs to anyone to do this.
Why should we condone it? No, we should not do this.</p><p>But there are other elements. For example, drug
propaganda. Do we want our young people to use drugs? Why should we condone the promotion of drug use? This is a degradation of society, a degradation of young
people, and a degradation of the nation.</p><p>Do we want to degenerate? Someone wants to promote drugs – so let them. But we should not do this, and in no way should we
encourage it, and we should not turn a blind eye either. Only, we need a different way of dealing with these trends.</p><p>Another example: it has become trendy to promote suicide among young people. So what do you say, let's go now and hang
ourselves, or what? Then you go first, not me. You do not want to, right? This
cannot be allowed in the youth environment. That is what I said – you take the lead.</p><p> This is different from catching, restricting or telling someone to ”do as I do.“ No, this is not aviation. Here you
have to act differently. Are there any different methods? Of course there are.
We need to carefully and calmly build our case, convince people of the greater appeal
of other values. But you cannot ban it outright, I agree with you.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b> Are there, in addition to the Ukrainian media,
media representatives from other countries as well? Our Japanese colleagues from
Kyodo Tsushin in the middle of this centre section, please, take the floor.
Please, pass the microphone there. </p><p><b>Hirofumi Sugizaki:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Good afternoon.</p><p><b>Hirofumi Sugizaki:</b> Hirofumi Sugizaki,Kyodo Tsushin, Japan.</p><p>It is natural
that my question is, unfortunately, about the peace treaty that, as I understand, our countries are seeking to sign. After your meeting with Mr Shinzo
Abe in Singapore, where you agreed to push the negotiating process forward on the basis of the Soviet-Japanese Declaration of 1956, our public’s only concern
is about how many islands we are going to get: nil, two, three or four – we do
not know. On the other hand, as I understand, the Russians are also puzzled, as they mainly ask questions like, “Why should we return them?” Some people even approach
us with a threat: “We will not yield an inch of our land.” And so on. The question
is about the delimitation that we must carry out. But if our new treaty – a peace
treaty – is confined to the delimitation of borders, this will not be enough
and will not be interesting to our nations, and people will not understand
this. What new idea do you think should be embedded in a treaty to bring our relations
to a new level?</p><p>There is
another question that I cannot fail to ask in connection with the above. Russia – and you yourself – has brought up security issues recently, I mean the deployment of the US missile defence system in Japan and the possibility of deploying American troops and military infrastructure on the islands should
they be transferred to Japan. We are holding negotiations at an expert level,
but in military matters Japan almost fully depends on the US. Do you think
these issues can be resolved on a bilateral basis, or will you have to deal
directly with the US? Thank you very much.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/mk6rhdWtZxMZoBZKQ33AAmJD4X3octWX.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/FiY4JdDDDTaDP3ivlpAQzWoAsFL0sQcO.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(7, 118, 254);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #0776fe 0%, rgba(7,118,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #171a25 0%, rgba(23,26,37,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #d0ab8d 0%, rgba(208,171,141,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #85604b 0%, rgba(133,96,75,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Let us talk about the final part
of your question so that we do not forget what you said. The issues of security
are crucially important, including when signing a peace treaty. You spoke about
the deployment of the US military infrastructure in Japan, but it is already there,
the largest US base is in Okinawa, it has been there for decades, as we know.</p><p>Now, about Japan’s ability to take part in this
decision-making. To us, this is an unclear, closed issue. We do not understand
the level of Japan’s sovereignty in making such decisions. You know better than
all other colleagues, and I know too that the Okinawa Governor is opposed to some decisions related to improving and expanding the base. He is against it,
but he cannot do anything about it. People who live there are also against it.</p><p>There is a lot of evidence of that; there have
been opinion polls and protests demanding the withdrawal of this base. And, in any case, they are opposed to strengthening the US Air Force part of the base that
is there. There are plans to improve and expand it, and it is happening despite
the fact that everybody is against it.</p><p>We do not know what will happen after the peace
treaty is concluded, but without an answer to this question it will be very
difficult to make any crucial decisions. And, of course, we are concerned about
the plans to place ABM systems there. I told the United States this many times
and I will repeat again that we do not consider this to be defensive weapons;
this is part of the US strategic nuclear potential placed outside. And these
systems, they are synchronised with the missile strike systems.</p><p>So there are no illusions and we understand everything.
But nevertheless we are sincerely striving and will strive to sign a peace
treaty with Japan. It is because I am confident, and Prime Minister Abe shares
my confidence, that the current state of affairs is not normal. Both Japan and Russia are interested in a complete settlement of our relations, and it is not
only because we need something from Japan in terms of the economy. Our economy
is more or less developing.</p><p>Just this morning, Economic Development Minister
Maxim Oreshkin reported on his trip to Japan. There is some progress, including
an agreement on deliveries, on opening the Japanese market to Russian meat and poultry products. There are other improvements as well. Therefore, we are
moving forward, and will continue to move forward, as it will be necessary. But
the normalisation is important to us, both for Russia and Japan. It is a difficult process, but we are ready to move forward together with our
colleagues.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b>
Thank you. As you may know, British media regulator Ofcom has just found RT
guilty of violating broadcasting regulations and is looking into the possibility of introducing sanctions against it. I saw an RT correspondent
somewhere here. Let us give him the floor, as he is the main source of such
information.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, please. </p><p><b>Ilya Petrenko:</b>
Thank you, Mr Peskov.</p><p>Good afternoon. My name isIlya Petrenko from the Russia Today television
channel.</p><p>But I have a different question.
First, I would like to inquire about a recent decision to simplify procedures
for the people of Ukraine to obtain Russian citizenship. Our channel often
dealt with this issue, as well as with bureaucracy. It goes without saying that
this is an important step, but I would like to ask you to explain the logic of this from a purely political standpoint. If this is so essential, and if this
is needed to help people in eastern Ukraine, why didn’t we do it earlier? Are
you not afraid that bureaucracy will persist, and that papers will, from now
on, be placed to the left, rather than the right? </p><p>I would also like to come back to the question from my Izvestia colleague. There is the Skripal scandal and the Western response to it. Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian journalist, was murdered, and this incident caused an entirely
different response. Kirill Vyshinsky and Maria Butina, as well as Huawei Chief Financial Officer
were arrested. And Donald Trump is saying openly that sheis
a bargaining chip in a trade war. My colleague wanted to know if we would ever
see this happening in Russia, when foreign citizens would be arrested under
far-fetched pretexts and exchanged for someone else. Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Let us start with the last part of your question. I do not want to comment on US-Chinese relations, who arrested whom and for what actions, etc. This
is a very sensitive area, and we will not act according to the laws of the Code
of Hammurabi here. The law of retaliation states, “An eye for an eye or a tooth for a tooth.” We need to act very cautiously here, and we need to be real. We will respond if certain people violate Russian legislation, regardless
of their national and state affiliation. But we will not arrest innocent people
simply to exchange them for someone else later on.</p><p>As for the fate of Russian
nationals, we do care about them, including the fact that Butina is being forced
to admit something over there. I cannot understand what she could possibly have
admitted, since she was not following any instructions from the Russian Government
or its agencies. I am saying this because I mean it, no matter what she says
under the threat of being sentenced to 12 or 15 years in prison. It is
understandable that together with her lawyer she is fighting to get out of prison. I do not quite understand why they put her there in the first place. There
were simply no grounds for it. But now this is a question of saving face for them and finding a way out. I am primarily referring to the US justice system.
We will see how it plays out. We do care, and we will keep an eye on this case
and provide our support accordingly.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/YGQM1A9pGnXqA6efohhUgLLuc3cFnNx5.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/JspqHuNdW6AREElTXIEQmpgyK9yOWrl4.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(37, 37, 47);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #25252f 0%, rgba(37,37,47,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #1365d7 0%, rgba(19,101,215,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #c09580 0%, rgba(192,149,128,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #5a3653 0%, rgba(90,54,83,0) 100%);" width="386" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image vertical"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p>As for the Skripals and Khashoggi,
no comment is required. Khashoggi was obviously murdered, and everyone
acknowledged it. Skripal is alive, thank Heaven. Nevertheless, Russia was
slapped with a salvo of sanctions in this connection, with no end in sight,
which contrasts with complete silence in the second case. This is a politically-driven, Rusophobic approach. It serves as a pretext for attacking
Russia once more. Without the Skripal case, they would have come up with
something else. This is quite obvious to me. Their only goal is to contain
Russia and prevent it from emerging as a potential competitor. I do not see any
other end to it.</p><p>Regarding red tape on citizenship
matters. You said “red tape.” How so? Red tape is perennial. You cannot defeat
it. At the same time, you cannot live without it either, and this has to be
said as well. It is true that there must be rules for this bureaucracy and governance mechanisms, etc.</p><p>Regarding naturalisation, this does
not have to do only with what is taking place in southeastern Ukraine. Our
initiatives do not target exclusively people living in these territories. The Government is currently working on amendments to the relevant law on citizenship and naturalisation. What for? These efforts are designed to show
that we do not seek and will not support policies of division or the ones
designed to alienate the peoples of Russia and Ukraine. What are the current
[Ukrainian] authorities doing? What is their mission? What are they trying to achieve on the back of Russophobia they are promoting? They are practically
admitting that they are pursuing a historic task of separating the peoples of Russia and Ukraine. This is what they are up to. And for that, they can get
away with anything.</p><p>Your colleague from the Ukrainian
media talked about the challenges faced by people living in Donbass and the Lugansk Region, and their poor living standards. But is it any better in Ukraine? The situation is quite similar compared to Donbass, and it is getting
worse all the time. Anything can be forgiven within the country, and even more
so outside it against the backdrop of war, hostilities and tensions. And they
are getting paid for this. They are about to receive another IMF tranche. We do
understand what this is all about: just enough to pay out pensions and salaries
to social sector employees, and the future
generations will have to foot the bill. For this reason the overall situation
is quite unfavourable. I believe this to be the case for the economy, society
and domestic political processes. But our nations are very close and share the same history, so we will do everything to move in this direction.</p><p> The law on citizenship is currently being amended,
and it will be adopted in early 2019.</p><p><b>Yury Abumov:</b>
Yury Abumov, Khakassia newspaper.</p><p>Mr President, I would like to ask
about the latest regional elections. It is no secret that in some regions, they
were quite turbulent and tense, and sometimes even long, like in Primorye, where
they have just ended, and Khakassia actually set a record of holding elections
that went on for two whole months.</p><p>But the most important thing is that,
as a result of the protest vote, opposition parties’ candidates won. In particular, a candidate from the Communist Party won in Khakassia, and candidates
from LDPR won in Khabarovsk and in Vladimir Region. This raises some questions.</p><p>First, why do you think this happened?
Second, why, contrary to the tradition you established, have you not met with the elected regional heads yet? And most importantly, how do you intend to build
relations with the regions where the opposition parties won? Because there are
concerns that the federal Government may cut their funding and support – there
are such fears.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Do not worry about it. It is strange that this question even occurred.</p><p>About the meetings. The elections in Vladivostok were held just last Sunday, and that is why there were no meetings.
They will be, and they are scheduled for next week, I believe. We will have the State Council meeting, and, I have already instructed the Executive Office to schedule a separate meeting with the newly elected heads of the regions you
have just mentioned. We had to wait for the voting results in Vladivostok. This
is the first point.</p><p>Second. This is not the first time
that representatives of opposition parties win elections, is it? For several
years now, an LDPR representative has been heading Smolensk; in Omsk, there is
someone from United Russia, I think, and in other regions, there are
representatives of the Communist Party. So what? They are working; everything
is fine.</p><p>I am not a member of any party. True,
I created the United Russia, but the President is not a member of any party.
And the main thing for me is that people in the cities and regions of the Russian Federation feel that life is changing for the better.</p><p>In fact, if they cast their vote for a specific person who does not represent the United Russia party, that is their
choice. I will help in every way any elected leader of the region.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/jMIBsXIOAQYZlii5b6de69q8QDPnRJzA.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/5xxqHE4vFDbfCIgBENh1ECQ2LzKAr3Zw.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(0, 81, 255);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #0051ff 0%, rgba(0,81,255,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #556364 0%, rgba(85,99,100,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #bcc3d5 0%, rgba(188,195,213,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #dc0918 0%, rgba(220,9,24,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p> The only question is that the newly elected heads
of regions themselves should rise to the challenge, should be able to fulfil the electoral promises they made to the people.</p><p><b>Yelena Glushakova:</b> My name is Yelena Glushakova, and I am from RIA Novosti. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Good afternoon. </p><p><b>Yelena Glushakova: </b>I have also brought a picture,
Masha and the Bear, that relates to the topic of my question. As my colleagues
have said, Russia has been living under a huge amount of the most varied
sanctions for the past few years. It can be hard to keep track at times, and,
in some cases, they are vowing to introduce sanctions against cartoon characters.</p><p>But this is beside the point. My question is more serious. They are planning to introduce even more
serious sanctions; for example, US lawmakers are preparing for this. And is
Russia prepared for a new round of sanctions escalation? Does the Government
have any plan for minimising their impact on the Russian economy? And what do
you think the impact is, all the more so given the widely differing views
expressed on it? </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Well, we have discussed sanctions
many times. If you want to discuss this issue once again, that is okay with me.
</p><p>Throughout virtually its
entire history, Russia has faced various restrictions and sanctions. Really its entire history. </p><p>If you look at the history of the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, you will see that
the situation is always the same. You can read diplomatic correspondence dating
to the 19<sup>th</sup> century and the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.
Everything is the same. They urged Russian diplomats to quickly establish order
in the Caucasus and to do many other things. Nothing changes. </p><p>How can this be
explained? I have already discussed this, and I hope that an overwhelming
majority of today’s audience also realises that it is related to Russia’s
growing might and its greater competitiveness. A mighty and powerful player is
emerging, one that has to be reckoned with, even if others would rather not.</p><p>Quite recently, they
believed that a country like that no longer existed, but it turns out it does
and it must be reckoned with. Our country has a population of 160 million. This
is not just some wishful thinking on the part of its leaders, it represents the interests of the people that we are defending. By the way, we are carefully
defending these interests with calm and restraint, nothing boorish. But we are going
about our business, and we will continue to move in this direction.</p><p> Speaking of present-day
sanctions, they have just mentioned the Skripals and Khashoggi incidents. So,
is there any logic here? No, there is none. This is just a pretext for taking
additional action to contain Russia.</p><p>Our economy, as it has been said many times, has adapted to these
external restrictions. Look, in the beginning of this meeting I mentioned that
after the 2008−2009 global crisis, our GDP dropped by 7.8 percent. There were
no sanctions at the time. After the sanctions were imposed in 2014, the drop
was 2.5 percent.</p><p>You asked how we assess this situation? We always assess it in our
favour. But let us look at how our opponents see it – those who impose the sanctions.
For example, the US Treasury Department believes that this 2.5-percent drop in 2015 was one-third due to the sanctions and two-thirds due to the collapsed
prices on energy sources, mainly, oil. In fact, I think that one-third is too
much. But all, right, they did affect our GDP.</p><p>The sanctions also affect those who introduced them. According to the European Parliament, the European economy lost around 500 billion euros due to the sanctions against Russia because they lost our market, they under-export
and they under-import certain goods from us. The number of jobs has dropped.</p><p>It is significant for them because many EU countries suffer from a very
high unemployment rate. In Spain, if I am not mistaken, it is still around 15
percent. We have 4.8 percent and they have 15 percent, you know. And the development of global trade, which lost over 400 billion, is also a result of such an unpredictable policy, including sanctions. This policy is harmful to everybody.</p><p>I will repeat once again, our economy has adapted to this. Yes, there
are some adverse effects but look, there are also positive sides to these
sanctions. What are they? The sanctions made us switch on our brains in many
areas and Western experts also acknowledge this. The share of Russian transport
machine building was 98 percent in 2017. Automobile production accounted for 85
percent. Several other industries, also key areas, accounted for around 80
percent.</p><p>This year, we spent 600 billion rubles on import substitution, including
125 to 128 billion from the federal budget. I will not even mention agriculture.
We had to compensate for the imports in the market. Yes, unfortunately, this
resulted in a short-term price increase in the domestic food market but right now,
the prices have stabilised to a large extent in this sector of the economy and agriculture has made a breakthrough that we could not have ever imagined.</p><p> Since 2000, the amount of exports has increased 16-fold,
which is just unbelievable except it is actually happening. There are negative
and positive sides but in any case, we would like the world economy to develop
without any shocks, unlawful measures or external restrictions, to develop
naturally, for its own benefit. </p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/THj7tiTtn0cEZ7Hd8UiAtQrO9R7HMNEo.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/FKIV6D5UtFzgT8V8AQqpSURq5ACEFCRh.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(51, 40, 34);background:linear-gradient(0deg, #332822 0%, rgba(51,40,34,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #066cee 0%, rgba(6,108,238,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #9e928b 0%, rgba(158,146,139,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #eb0d1b 0%, rgba(235,13,27,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Dmitry Peskov</b>:
Now, to our respected regional media. Chelyabinsk, please.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Wait a second. I see a poster saying ‘KGB and children.’ Today is December 20,
the day of the Cheka. What do you mean, there are children in the KGB? What is
it? Please, hand them a microphone.</p><p><b>Remark</b>: As my good friend said once, “We all are the children of the KGB, but life has taught
us different things.”</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
If you are the children of the KGB, why does life teach you? The KGB should do
that.</p><p><b>Question</b>: Mr
President, society strongly demands social justice. According to Levada Centre,
66 percent of respondents feel nostalgic about the Soviet Union. And here is my question: do you think that a restoration of socialism is possible in Russia? </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
I think this is impossible. </p><p>I believe that the deep changes that
have taken place in our society make restoring socialism in the sense you mean
impossible.</p><p>There can be social elements in the economy and the social sector, but expenses will always exceed profits, and as a result, the economy would be at a dead end.</p><p> But the just distribution of resources, the fair
treatment of people who live below the poverty line, and a state policy aimed to lower the number of people who have to live like that, to provide the majority
of people with healthcare services and education in acceptable conditions, if
this is the socialism we are talking about, we are holding to the very same
policy. Our national programmes that we talked about in the beginning of this
meeting, are mostly aimed at all this.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b>
If it is not about the KGB then please go ahead. You are from Chelyabinsk, aren’t
you?</p><p><b>Yana Skonechnaya:</b> Thank you.</p><p>My name is Yana Skonechnaya, I represent the Southern Urals State Television and Radio Company, the city of Chelyabinsk.</p><p>I have a question that concerns not
only Chelyabinsk, but all of Russia. I am talking about waste management, waste
sorting, in particular. Not a single city in our country has either the industry for separate trash collection, or a culture of waste sorting. I have a colleague who does separate trash collection, but her entire apartment is
filled with trash bags, because she needs to collect a certain amount of it,
then load it into her car, take it to the other end of the city and only then dispose
of it. Of course, some regions have already begun building the appropriate
infrastructure, but this is all a drop in the ocean. You raised this issue on many
occasions. So why is it so hard to make it happen? Why can we not use international
experience and have our waste properly recycled?</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You know, the answer is fairly simple. The situation is complicated,
but the answer is simple – we have never dealt with it. For decades, since Soviet
times, we have been dumping garbage in pits, to put it colorfully. No one has
ever engaged in its processing, unless minimally in certain areas, while we
produce, I believe, 70 million tonnes of trash annually, and there is no place
to dispose of it. The amount of waste tends to increase with the development of industry, including the development of the consumer goods industry. As chemistry
progresses, the amount of plastic trash increases. In the Pacific, there are
entire islands of it the size of France and several metres thick. Plastic tends
to accumulate in these spots and there is nothing you can do about it. However,
this is the Pacific, while we dump it all in landfills.</p><p>We need to address several key and top priorities. First, we need to eliminate illegal landfills. Second, we
should create a waste treatment industry. What your colleague is doing is great,
and is highly commendable, but this is a problem for environmentally conscious people.
The state, first of all the regions, and then the municipalities, should create
conditions for separate trash collection and subsequent recycling. I understand
the people who oppose the construction of waste disposal plants. You have just
mentioned international best practices. It is necessary to use them in our
country. We often manage to do so. Here, we need to do the same. Some environmentalists
and even some citizens object to building even waste incineration plants in the regions. These plants need to be of high quality and efficient, so as not to have to scrimp on the filters for them. They are the most expensive part of the processing and incineration plants. Everything has be done according to the corresponding
technology and methodology.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/EzqW2SsQjJwMwA1zbykImtcA7pUYNBru.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/AXjIAhJr916Ph8neeVxYUZSkvWJWMWgM.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(16, 106, 254);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #106afe 0%, rgba(16,106,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #c2a28b 0%, rgba(194,162,139,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #42223f 0%, rgba(66,34,63,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #eeffff 0%, rgba(238,255,255,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p> In Tokyo (as our colleague will confirm, I think),
waste incineration plants are located in central parts of the city. There is no

this will be enough, but we must have at least 200 such plants in our country.</p><p><b>Alexander Ilyin:</b> Alexander Ilyin, Yakutia newspaper.</p><p>Mr President, my question is this.
The Crimean Bridge has become a symbol of Crimea’s return to its homeland. The bridge over the Lena River can become a symbol of the development of Russia’s Asian
part. I would like to ask you, should we expect this bridge to be built? If so,
when? Because the Yakut people really need it. Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I see. A symbol is always good; it is always a landmark of some stage
of work that has been completed and a springboard for further progress. In this
sense, the Crimean Bridge is both. I agree with you: it is both a symbol of Crimea’s
reunification with Russia, and an opportunity for the peninsula’s development. It
opens opportunities for development. It is very important.</p><p>The same applies to the bridge across
the Lena River. You said it has to spur development. This needs to be calculated
carefully. The cost of this project – and we have been talking about it for a long time, for several years – is very high. It is an expensive project. We
need to look if it will simply stop at the city and that is it, or if there is
a possibility of developing the region as a whole, the area on the other side
of the Lena River: the local economy, infrastructure, access to mineral deposits.
Here is what we need to decide. We need to match the costs against the end
result for the economy of the region as a whole. If our colleagues at the Transport
Ministry and the Economic Development Ministry agree, then of course we will implement
this project.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Let us go on. <i>Nature, Motherland,

remain in force. But local officials are reluctant to comply with them.
Therefore, I would like to ask you to pay attention to the Don River – this is as great a Russian river as the Volga and the Neva. This is my first point.</p><p>And second, Mr President. </p><p>On December 15, you chaired a meeting of the Council for Culture [and Art] at the Constantine Palace. All the questions asked there were very good and correct, including about drug
addiction. But Andrei Mikhalkov-Konchalovsky asked one of the key questions,
and I would like to follow up on this issue after thinking it over.</p><p>He said that Russia now lacks an ambitious
national development idea. The Russian Empire had the following triad: Orthodox
Christianity, autocracy and nationality. The Soviet Union had the moral code of the builder of communism. Today, it is unclear what kind of society we are
building, but it looks more like the amoral code of the builder of capitalism.</p><p>I came up with a triad of my own,
and I would like to ask you to get our federal television channels, including
Channel One, NTV and Rossiya, to hold a nationwide discussion of what kind of country
and society we are building, after all. So, I suggest the following triad: nature,
motherland and the people. Its three component – nature, motherland and the people – cannot exist without one another. And that is why we now watch shows about
who left whom and who cheated on whom. That is, there is a kind of media
lawlessness. And if we raise the issue of all television shows …</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b>
What is your question, please?</p><p><b>Sergey Lisovsky:</b> Yes, is it possible to create a television show on strategically
important issues related to Russia’s long-term development? </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> It is always very interesting to speak with Andrei
Mikhalkov-Konchalovsky. He is very insightful. He has his own opinions, which
he is not afraid to express, whether you agree or not. He is not a conformist,
and he speaks his mind. He is an insightful person.</p><p>I have repeatedly discussed whether
we have an idea for building the state, the country – the foundation on which
to build. I believe that patriotism in the best sense of the word, rather than the basest, simply has to be the foundation for strengthening our state in the broadest and noblest sense of this word. </p><p>As for our many channels on television and online that probably are not worth the air time they take up, you
know, Daniil Granin (I believe that I mentioned this some time ago) discussed
the matter at our last meeting. </p><p>We had a long private conversation,
and I never saw him again, he passed away some time later. He said: “Look, you
have to do something about this.” I asked: “What are you talking about?” “We
are all tired of it,” he replied. “What do you mean?” I asked. “All the television
channels are telling us about people who stole money, how much, how they did
it. I am really sick and tired of it. Are there really no happy and positive
events in life here?” I said: “Well, that is their programming choice.”</p><p>As I see it, things are actually
gradually changing for the better, to some extent, the information is becoming
more balanced perhaps, although I don’t go online or watch television very
often just because I don’t have enough time.</p><p>I try to keep an eye on the media
environment, and I get the impression that there has been some improvement. But
there would certainly be no harm in discussing what you have suggested. I will need
to speak with my colleagues. </p><p>They can hear you now, and I hope
that they will respond.</p><p> The Chicago Tribune’s correspondent over there, you
have the floor, please. </p><p><b>Rachel Marsden:</b> President Putin, Rachel Marsden with the Tribune Publishing out of Chicago, United States. </p><p>Yesterday,

your position with respect to his statements, both on the withdrawal of the American troops from Syria and also with his statement regarding the defeat of ISIS by the United States? </p><p>And, secondly,
do you have concern that the American troops will remain in some form? There
has been much discussion, for example, around the presence, potentially, of contractors in other jurisdictions where the United States is either out of militarily or might want to be out of militarily but in a more discreet way. </p><p>Thank you
very much.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>As concerns the defeat of ISIS, overall I agree
with the President of the United States. I already said that we achieved
significant progress in the fight against terrorism in that territory and delivered major strikes on ISIS in Syria.</p><p>There is a risk of these and similar groups migrating to neighbouring regions and Afghanistan, to other countries, to their home countries, and they are partly
returning.</p><p>It is a great danger for all of us, including Russia, the United States, Europe, Asian
countries, including Central Asia. We know that, we understand the risk fully.
Donald is right about that, and I agree with him.</p><p>As concerns
the withdrawal of American troops, I do not know what that is. The United
States have been present in, say, Afghanistan, for how long? Seventeen years,
and every year they talk about withdrawing the troops. But they are still
there. This is my second point.</p><p>Third. So
far, we have not seen any evidence of their withdrawal but I suppose it is possible, the more so because we are progressing towards a political
settlement. The current issue on the agenda is building a constitutional
committee.</p><p>By the way,
when we met in Istanbul – I mean Russia, Turkey, France and Germany – we agreed
to make every possible effort to create this constitutional committee and Russia, for its part, has done everything in its power for this to happen.</p><p>As strange
as it may seem, we fully agreed on the list of members with President al-Assad,
who designated 50 people and was involved in selecting 50 more from civil
society. Despite the fact that he is not happy with everything, he agreed with
this.</p><p>Turkey,
which represents the interests of the opposition, also agreed. Iran agreed. We
submitted the list to the UN and, as Minister Lavrov reported to me just
yesterday, unexpectedly, prompted by our partners – Germany, France and the United States – UN representatives (Mr de Mistura) decided to wait and see.</p><p>I do not
understand what is going on there but at any rate, I want to believe that this
work is in its final stage. Maybe not by the end of this year but in the beginning of the next the list will be agreed and this will open the next stage
of the settlement, which will be political settlement.</p><p>Is the presence of American troops required there? I do not think it is. However, let
us not forget that their presence, the presence of your troops, is illegitimate
as it was not approved by a UN Security Council resolution. The military
contingent can only be there under a resolution of the UN Security Council or at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian Government. Russian troops were
invited by the Syrian Government. The United States did not get either of these
so if they decide to withdraw their troops, it is the right decision.</p><p>There is
another very important component in this process. Despite all the disagreements, our specialists, our military personnel, security services and foreign ministries have established a rather constructive dialogue to address
acute issues in combating terrorism in Syria. Overall, we are satisfied with
our cooperation.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/wyYgYwbyzQN85Ug8fVOQDdoYUYMUoDgo.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/u3pPAJuXgkvIYmtz4nOAQlbXyRYtTfPP.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(36, 41, 62);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #24293e 0%, rgba(36,41,62,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #756463 0%, rgba(117,100,99,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #385087 0%, rgba(56,80,135,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #5a4941 0%, rgba(90,73,65,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Remark: </b><i>(From the audience)</i> You will not forget about Gazprom,
will you?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
How can I forget about Gazprom? Just a second.</p><p><b>Olga Ivanova</b>:
Good afternoon. My name is Olga, I represent the Selskaya Zhisn (Rural Life)
newspaper. It marked its 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary last March. You
congratulated our editorial board, and we are very thankful for that.</p><p>Here is my question. Judging by the current statistics, the growth rate of the agricultural sector has slowed down
despite the absence of competition because of the sanctions and the terrific
environment. How can you explain that? And does that bother you?</p><p>And another one: there are no
national projects for agriculture, why is that?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
As for national projects and agriculture, agriculture has long been a national
project in Russia. It receives state support worth hundreds of billions of rubles, and it will keep receiving it, both large and small farms, all segments
of the sector.</p><p>As for the low growth rate. Yes, it
is true. Are we worried? No. And the environment is far from being terrific,
our agricultural producers work in difficult conditions. </p><p>First, there is still competition.
Thank God, competition is developing inside the country, and this is very
important for the development of this sector of the economy. There is also
foreign competition. Not all countries imposed sanctions, which means we did not
take counter-measures against them. We introduced such measures against the EU
countries, the US and other countries that imposed sanctions against Russia at the instruction of the US. But the majority of countries in the world did not,
and there are many of them. They supply us with their products and therefore
there is competition.</p><p> Speaking of what is going on in agriculture, these
are statistics and they relate to grain production. As you know, last year we
had a record-breaking grain harvest of 135.5 million tonnes. This is the main
factor influencing the statistics. This year, due to unfavourable weather
conditions – and in 27 regions a state of emergency was declared – the harvest
was smaller: 110.5 million tonnes. Therefore, as compared to last year, there
is a decline. However, these 110 million tonnes rank third in terms of production volume in the past 25 years. It is a very good result. Combined with
the reserves from last year, potential exports grew to 52.5 million tonnes. We
will fulfil all obligations and contracts. So we are not worried at all. </p><p>In the agricultural sector, there are
areas where we need to act and maintain our efforts. What are these areas? We
need to improve our competitiveness, and expand the infrastructure, in order to boost exports, among other things. Incidentally, last year exports totalled 20
billion, and this year they will reach 25 billion. There was a time when these
figures were hard to imagine. Russia exports 16 billion worth of arms, while
agricultural exports are at 25 billion. We will continue to support
agricultural and export infrastructure development; about 400 billion rubles
will go toward these ends over the next few years. This includes developing
ports, roads and so forth, and supporting exports with financial instruments.
This is how we can enhance our competitiveness. Of course, professional
training, selection breeding, etc. are also important. You know this better
than I do.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/5GcrlRKTrvl78NJpUd5ipAfC5pmdCHjJ.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/btpPo9enEvZ35ZACUSzbseCn3v6UIkkh.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(77, 112, 174);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #4d70ae 0%, rgba(77,112,174,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #e2d7d6 0%, rgba(226,215,214,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #761e23 0%, rgba(118,30,35,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #aa986b 0%, rgba(170,152,107,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p>Second, we need to promote high

from some countries have a direct bearing on the people living in Crimea who
voted for reunification with Russia in 2014. Can you explain what you meant? How
do we deal with this? Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> I did say this, even though I can hardly recall
where I was at the time, but I can explain it. This is an interesting
situation. What we hear from the outside is that Russia annexed Crimea. But
what does annexation mean? It means a forcible takeover. If this had been an annexation and a takeover by force, the people in Crimea would have had nothing
to do with it and would not be to blame. But if they came out and voted, this
was not an annexation. So what is going on? After all, sanctions were imposed against
them, against you. What are these sanctions? Restriction on mobility, restrictions
on border crossings, visas, financial transactions, insurance companies, marine
infrastructure use and the use of other facilities. These measures affect
almost everyone living there. They were the ones targeted by these sanctions,
and this is not just about singling out specific individuals like the government leaders in the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, but about
targeting everyone. If they had had nothing to do with it, if it had been annexation,
why were the people sanctioned? But if you were sanctioned for taking part in a specific vote, then they would have to admit that it actually took place. This
is what this is about, and this is what I meant.</p><p><b>Alexander Yunashev</b>: Good afternoon. Alexander

measured in hundreds of millions of rubles. These grants are related to content, and we are allocating, I believe, 144 billion rubles to this end.

not just tell the truth, but also do their job objectively and responsibly, so
that they act as a serious soft power, and not just as a medium to resolve

journalism?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: You know, the truth is not in power …</p><p><b>Marina Volynkina</b>: The power is in the truth.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: The power is in the truth, that’s

politicised, which undermines media credibility with many people.</p><p>People are dividing everything they see or read

as objective as possible in matters that are vital for our country and the rest
of the world.</p><p> This is important not just for me, but for all of us. I hope that this trend is still there, and I think it will continue.</p><p>Let us have the question about Afghanistan, as I promised.</p><p><b>Question: </b>On December 6, Russia refused to support

conducting separate talks with the Taliban. In light of this, what will be the future of the Moscow format of consultations on Afghanistan, which were

we must understand the subject of these talks and their possible outcome. If
there is a force that controls the bulk of Afghanistan’s territory, its opinion
must be taken into account, but this should be done openly and publicly, so it
is clear what we are talking about.</p><p>I believe that this is probably the essence of our Foreign Ministry’s
position at the talks. We are not against a settlement. Overall, we believe
that the problem can be settled exclusively through an agreement between all
parties to the political process in Afghanistan.</p><p>Until then, we will need to reinforce our military base in Tajikistan.
We believe that the people of Afghanistan will eventually reach an agreement,
and that all political forces and ethnic groups will reach a consensus.</p><p> We will facilitate this process as much as we can,
including by promoting economic cooperation with Afghanistan and by taking part

give his name – was asked during talks: “What is the situation with human
rights in your country?” [<i>Allusion to a Soviet-era joke.]</i> He looked at his interlocutor and asked: “Who is the human being you are talking about?” I would like to ask you: who is the human
being you are referring to? </p><p><b>Anna
Vavilova-Dollezhal:</b>
In our country this primarily applies to legal entities, while Maria Butina was
arrested in the United States as a private individual. This law [on foreign
agents] has been in effect in the US since 1938. I would like to ask you if it
makes sense to borrow from the experience of our Western partners here. </p><p>I have another question that is very important
to us. I represent Tsargrad TV channel and we want to know what you think about
the situation developing around Orthodoxy globally, given recent sectarian
activities by the Patriarchate of Constantinople and Kiev. Perhaps, everyone is
now beginning to realise that the United States is the main player here. So it
turns out that religion is heavily dominated by geopolitics. Is that the case? </p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> Regarding the first part of your question, we have
relied on international experience when we passed the law on foreign agents.
This is not about bans. This law requires that any entity receiving funding
from abroad to carry out its public political activities must be registered as a foreign agent. That is it. Incidentally, this type of activity is banned in the United States and here you have the result: under this law Butina was
arrested and taken into custody and might be sentenced to 12 years in prison.
We do nothing of the sort here. Our law only requires registration for entities
receiving funding from abroad. There is nothing here to fear. Frankly speaking,
I do not see any problems here, as far as law enforcement is concerned.
However, we, of course, need to look into the matter. </p><p>When I meet with human rights
activists, they point out certain drawbacks in this law, aspects actually related
to charity rather than politics. And I think they are right. We need to pay
close attention to what is happening in life and make adjustments where
necessary. This must not interfere with our normal life and must not hinder the activity of honest and decent people who want to solve problems, including with
the support of like-minded people abroad. There is nothing wrong with this. But
political activity must, of course, be prohibited. Well, not prohibited but at least subject to law.</p><p>Second, the Orthodox church. The situation with the Orthodox church defies comprehension. This is direct interference of the state
in religious life. This has not happened since the Soviet Union. But,
unfortunately, it is happening in Ukraine now. They created this breakaway
church of the Istanbul curacy. They did not like the Moscow curacy so let it be
the Istanbul curacy. </p><p>Note that
the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchy was completely
independent. Perhaps few people know this but it was actually a completely
independent church. They did everything independently, including the election
of bishops. The only connection was spiritual as they mentioned the name of Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia during sermons. That was all. Now look at how dependent they are becoming on Turkey, on the Turkish Patriarchy. Many
appointments and, most importantly, a lot of money. I think this is Bartholomew’s
main impelling motive, to bring this territory into subjection and make money
on it. I believe this is the main underlying motive – except for a tip from
Washington, of course. The fact that the State Secretary called Kiev about this
matter and discussed it is an outrage. Absolutely unacceptable. However, it is
happening.</p><p>Of course,
this is another indication of the fact that the measure is also related to the election campaign and is meant to further widen the gap between Russian and Ukrainian people. The rationale behind it is, without doubt, political, and it
is not good news for religious freedom in general. This is a clear and flagrant
violation of the freedom of religion. I am mostly concerned about the likelihood
that property redistribution will follow. This is already happening. This
redistribution could turn into a heavy dispute, if not bloodshed, God forbid. I am sorry for the people who are defending their interests. They are usually
helpless and unarmed. They are usually seniors and women. But there is, of course, the risk of property redistribution.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov</b>: You promised a word to Kolesnikov, Mr
President. We have been on for two hours now.</p><p><b>Andrei Kolesnikov</b>: Good afternoon. Andrei Kolesnikov, Kommersant
newspaper.</p><p>Mr President, the French protests against the fuel hike have, as everyone knows, morphed into a general protest against
everything. President Macron has had to impose emergency social and economic measures.
What is your take on the events in France? Are there any plans to raise fuel
prices in Russia? There has been much talk about it recently. How likely do you
believe it is that Russians would take to the streets, and what should the Government
prioritise in that case? Its responsibility to protect the rights of the protesters or the need to uphold the rule of law?</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>One does not exclude the other. Let’s begin
with the final part of your question. We certainly must ensure our citizens’
freedom of expression, their right to voice their opinions including by holding

legal.

they are seen from our shores. I believe that of course they have to do with
the rise in fuel prices. But the hike was a trigger that sparked the unrest
involving a large part of French society, and generally native French people.
Recent data suggest that a significant proportion of the French, over 7
percent, support this. However, I do not believe it would be right to judge the French authorities’ response to this. </p><p>What is the difference between what we see in Russia and the situation in France with regard to fuel prices and the rest? The French Government was deliberate in its decision to increase the price of petrochemicals and fuel, which means that the Government did it. It was a policy move. This initiative was intended to redistribute resources, in this case,
the resources of the population, and to use them to address other matters
related to the energy policy. The funds that the Government expected to raise
from gasoline, diesel fuel and motor oil sales were to go towards developing
alternative energy sources such as solar energy, wind power, and so on. This
was a deliberate move. The people did not like it, because they did not want to be the ones to pay for these changes.</p><p>What is happening in Russia? Gasoline prices
have been growing since mid-2018 as the price of oil went up on the global
markets. However, the Russian Government was prompt to take action in order to contain and even lower prices, and an agreement to this effect was reached with
the main oil companies and refineries. That is the difference: over there the price hike was a conscious move, they were the ones who did it, while the Russian Government is fighting to ensure that prices do not go up.</p><p>Of course, no one likes it when prices go up,
but the fact that the Government is acting this way is obvious. Whether it is
for the better or for worse is another question, but this is what is going on.
An agreement has been reached, and it covers a period until March 2019. Yes, an adjustment is possible when VAT goes up in early January, but I do not expect
it to be substantial. This should be an adjustment in the order of 1–1.5
percent, not more, after which the Government will carefully monitor
developments on the Russian and international markets.</p><p>I can share more details on this subject later
on, but generally speaking this worked, even if we had to micromanage the situation, and I hope that it will also work in the future, so that the Government will be able to prevent any sharp surges in fuel prices next year.</p><p><b>Remark:</b> <i>(From

you.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b> This is about the potential for protest in Russia.</p><p><b>Vladimir

for word, I asked them this question: “Is it possible that someone in a small
village will be left without television?” That is the question. They say no.
So, we agreed that we would proceed very carefully, in small steps.</p><p>Currently, Tver is undergoing such
an experiment, then you. So far, there have been no complaints in Tver. The governor reported to me that he had gone to almost every village and is on top
of things. They will help everyone in need of support in order to help them switch
to digital, including the small devices needed to receive television of such
quality. Then, another couple of regions, on and on …</p><p> Truth be told, there was a proposal to move fast
and be done in six months. I said, “No, we cannot do that. We must act very
carefully and monitor things on the ground and, of course, ensure the interests
of the people who cannot afford these consoles, even though they are not
expensive.” We will see how it goes in individual regions and then take small
steps along this path.</p><p><b>Sergei Brilyov:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President.</p><p>For understandable reasons, when
international politics are discussed at this news conference, it is commonly
about conflict, with the possible exception of China.</p><p>Today, on December 20, I wanted to mention
a project I am working on with my British colleagues. This unprecedented
project is on the history of cooperation between Soviet and British secret
services during the Great Patriotic War, and the story of 36 Soviet agents that
were sent to Nazi-occupied Europe. If you allow me, I will send the materials
to you through Mr Peskov. </p><p>In this connection, I cannot help
but ask you about the current status of Russian-British relations. Let us start
with the small things. After the G20 summit, Dmitry Peskov told us that he did
not know whether you had met with Theresa May, but you did meet with her. What
do you think of these relations? And another interesting question: How, in your
opinion, will Brexit impact Russia? What if it does affect us?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Regarding these meetings, there are many meetings at events like the G20; you cannot even list them all because everyone is busy, and we meet, as they say, on the sidelines.</p><p>What does “on the sidelines” mean? We
get up, we are walking near each other, you greet someone and say something to them. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and I greeted each other in about the same way and said a few words to each other. In my opinion,
Russian-British relations are at an impasse, and it is in the interests of both
states to move beyond this impasse.</p><p>How will Brexit impact us? The impact
will be minimal, but it will affect the entire European economy and the global
economy, as well. Therefore, it will affect us indirectly.</p><p>Are we interested in restoring full
relations with the United Kingdom or not? Yes, we are interested; besides, in my opinion, the United Kingdom, primarily its business community, is also
interested in this.</p><p>We know the British work
in our country – fairly actively, I can tell you. Flagships of the British
economy like British Petroleum, one of the key shareholders in our leading oil
and gas company, Rosneft, – they are working here, and continue to do so,
actively operating in our market, and they want to continue, and not just them.</p><p>Now, in connection with
Brexit – if this eventually goes through to the end, and, by the way, I understand the position of the Prime Minister, she is fighting for Brexit (let
them decide this for themselves, this is
none of our business, or else they might accuse us of wrongdoing again), but
the referendum did take place. So what can she do?</p><p>She must implement the will of the people as expressed in the referendum, or that is no referendum at all. Some didn’t like it – and the whole thing goes around and around. Is this democracy?
I wonder how the critics of this process will assess the situation if and when
some spit on this Brexit deal and carry out all these events again until they
satisfy someone. </p><p>So what is the point of holding
a referendum and what is the meaning of direct democracy? Well, anyway, this is
their concern, never mind. But, they are interested in our market, interested
in direct partnerships. We did not discuss this with the prime minister, but we
discussed it with our colleagues and friends; we have many in Britain,
especially among the businesspeople.</p><p>You know, if you look at direct foreign investment, where has most of the direct foreign investment come
from this year? From Britain – $22 billion. Germany is second, followed by Singapore. That says something, right?</p><p>True, this may be partly
due to the repatriation of our capital, because they have somewhat scared it off
over there, but all the same, there is huge interest in our agriculture (our
export potential is enormous and keeps growing), industrial production and the energy sector. There are so many areas.
And I hope that common sense will prevail.</p><p>What about the skis over
there? I find it interesting; it’s winter now. </p><p><b>Svetlana Shaganova:</b> Svetlana Shaganova, State

through their territory, have not had any gas for many years. Just recently, on December 7, Gazprom went ahead and said that it had no gas for the new
consumers residing on the territory of the entire Karelian Isthmus.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> The Karelian Isthmus, you say?</p><p><b>Viktor Smirnov:</b> The Karelian Isthmus, yes, two
Leningrad Region districts and a section of St Petersburg’s territory. They
believe the reconstruction of some compressor station for supplying people with
gas is unnecessary (either they do not have money to spare or have already
allocated it someplace else).</p><p>Similarly (this is just for the record, though), a couple of years ago,
a pipe was stolen there – simply stolen. It cost a total of 1.8 billion rubles.
No criminal proceedings have been initiated since.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I do not understand. Did someone dig
it out and drag it away, or what?</p><p><b>Viktor Smirnov:</b> No, it was not installed, but the paperwork was all in place. So it kind of exists, but kind of does not.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You mean, the money was allocated,
but no pipe was laid?</p><p><b>Viktor Smirnov:</b> Right. No criminal proceedings were
initiated either.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Where did this take place?</p><p><b>Viktor Smirnov:</b> Priozersky District. You have been
there before, you have seen it.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/zQAaTKOmkQmI5V9yCLgBPeM1XudwfB9w.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/Ka3BQT0dNEgT9N7F6y7e8F1wBnz3ojPc.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(9, 16, 29);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #09101d 0%, rgba(9,16,29,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #e3eaed 0%, rgba(227,234,237,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #9b8058 0%, rgba(155,128,88,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #60b2de 0%, rgba(96,178,222,0) 100%);" width="386" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image vertical"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> I have indeed. </p><p><b>Viktor Smirnov</b>: On top of this, the deadlines for connecting the Leningrad Region users to gas grids are often missed, but in the gas monopoly they use the beautiful words “postponement and synchronisation,”
annual. That is, the deadlines are missed, and missed, and missed again, but
this is synchronisation.</p><p>And the fourth point I would like to mention.
With all the problems in the gas monopoly and the problems of the residents who
also suffer from these problems (some have had no access to gas since 2009), despite
all this, the children of the board members, the specific individuals we wrote
about, have no qualms about taking top management positions in subsidiaries. And they have no qualms about posting photos of luxury cars on the internet, and flying
in business jets to watch football in Italy. How is that for national wealth,
Mr President? Aren’t they going too far?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Well, it always helps to keep
track of expenses, on superjet flights, to look what they actually did there, and what kind of football they watched. After all, Gazprom, among other things,
sponsors foreign football clubs, like FC Schalke 04 in Germany. But why does it
sponsor them? Because it does a lot of work there, in Germany, and in Italy too.
These contacts need to be maintained. As long as it is within in the bounds of common
sense, all is well, and we must always watch this very carefully. So you are
right to pay attention to this. I will also look what they fly on and where.</p><p>As for domestic gas supply, it is growing.
True, our sales on the foreign market are growing also. This year, exports will
top 200 billion cubic metres – this is a very good result, a historic high. This
is what Russia needs, not Gazprom, it is what our national economy and the federal budget need, because the bulk of Gazprom’s revenues, which then flow
into the budget, come from exports, as it should be.</p><p>As for internal issues and decisions on connection,
I repeat once again, things are moving forward. It is not only about Gazprom,
Gazprom lays the pipelines to populated areas, and then there is further
distribution, and the so-called last mile, so this problem should be resolved
with the help of the region.</p><p><b>Viktor Smirnov</b>: Well, the region has built it.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Built it?</p><p><b>Viktor Smirnov</b>: Yes.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Well, I will check it out. I do
not know, I will check and see.</p><p>Of course, Gazprom is driven by considerations
of economic feasibility, but in addition to economic feasibility, there are
social issues, of course, including the provision of gas to households in a given area.</p><p>I will see how it is built. You know, in any
case, very often there is a discrepancy between the statements of local
authorities and the reality. I will definitely pay attention to this.
Priozersky District is what I heard. Priozersky, right?</p><p><b>Viktor Smirnov</b>: Part of Priozersky, part of Vyborg, and part of St Petersburg.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Ok.</p><p><b>Viktor Smirnov</b>: Gazprom says that their station is
not ready.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: I assure you, I will definitely look into this
and respond.</p><p>Everything is not smooth sailing
with us, but things are more or less stable. Here is <i>Novaya Gazeta</i>, I am sure they will come up with something. Please
go ahead.</p><p><b>Ilya Azar:</b>

My colleagues and friends Alexander Rastorguyev, Orkhan Dzhemal and Kirill
Radchenko died in the Central African Republic this year.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> This is a major tragedy, I agree.</p><p><b>Ilya Azar:</b>
What do you know about the circumstances of their death and, in particular, the possible involvement of private military company <i>Wagner</i> in this?</p><p>Secondly, do you think it is right
that a businessman whom everyone calls your chef, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is
believed to be involved in managing PMC <i>Wagner</i>?</p><p>In general, what do you think about
private military companies? One gets the impression that you are somewhat
embarrassed by or deny their existence. Perhaps, we should be proud of them,
because they operate in Syria, Donbass, Central Africa and other countries.</p><p>And another short question. As you
are aware, human rights activist Lev Ponomaryov, a 77-year-old man, was
arrested and jailed for 15 days for a post on Facebook. What do you as a human
being think about this? Is that a normal thing to do?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Let us start with <i>Wagner</i> and chefs.</p><p>All my chefs are employed by the Federal Guard Service. They are servicemen holding different ranks. I have no
other chefs.</p><p>This matter should be made clear
once and for all so that we do not have to return to it in the future. If
someone wants to label someone, they are free to do so, and there is nothing
wrong with that. This is part of politicking in our country. There is even such
a thing as “safe food.” For your information, we do not outsource this job, and the Federal Guard Service employees do all the work.</p><p>Now, on to <i>Wagner</i> and what these people are doing. Everything must remain
within the law, everything. We can ban private security firms altogether, but
once we do so, I think you will be flooded with petitions demanding to protect
this section of the labour market. Almost a million people are employed there.
If this <i>Wagner</i> group breaks any laws,
the General Prosecutor’s Office will go ahead and give it a legal assessment.</p><p>Now, about their presence in foreign
countries. To reiterate, if they comply with Russian laws, they have every
right to work and promote their business interests anywhere in the world.</p><p>Finally, the tragedy that you
mentioned. It was certainly a tragedy. These people died and left behind
families and friends. In general, unfortunately, a lot of tragedies are connected
with journalists. I think we should never forget them, including the journalists who died in southeastern Ukraine under fire, or were killed in gun
attacks, practically assassinated. Please do not forget about them, either.</p><p>As far as I know, your colleagues travelled
to Africa as tourists, not even as journalists, without notifying local
authorities. According to the data available to date, some local groups are
behind this attack.</p><p> As far as I understand, an investigation is
underway. Unfortunately, there is no reliable information yet, but we strongly
hope that it will be eventually obtained. We are on top of this situation through
our diplomatic channels. I hope that at least at some point we will find out what
happened there. My heart goes out to you, to all members of the editorial board
and the families of the people who died there.</p><p><b>Sergei Milvit</b>:

decision to make it the capital of the Far Eastern Federal District. Thank you
very much.</p><p>At the last news conference I asked
you questions about ecology, a waste incineration plant, Snegovaya Pad and forest
clearance. Thank you very much for the closure of the waste incineration plant.
I hope it will not be reopened.</p><p>The only problem is that there are
some companies that would like to handle separated garbage but for some reason
the regional operator does not allow it because it is leased and a land plot
cannot be subleased and so on. </p><p>Recently we had elections and as you
know of course, the pension reform was the main reason for protests. This is
why the elections were drawn out, this was the main reason.</p><p>I would like to continue talking
about environmental protection and the sports complex that has not been
finished and house equity holders that have been
cheated – their residential houses have not been finished.
Dalkhimprom-Karyernaya is where our marines are deployed. There is also school #55
that was closed and now children have to go to faraway schools.</p><p>And one more thing. The lands of the forest fund are government property like the strategic Primvodokanal facility.
What is happening currently? To this day forests have not undergone cadastral
registration. They are being cut down and cottages are being built – nothing
has changed. </p><p>Lakes and water reservoirs at Primvodokanal that should be government property are now privately owned. I would like to ask you to clear up this question. </p><p><b>Remark</b>: Question!</p><p><b>Sergei Milvit</b>:
Ok. Excuse me please. We will move on to the next issue. If you could comment
briefly on the pension reform.</p><p>It seems to me that you were likely
deceived about the pension reform. I will explain why. It appears that the pension deficit for 2018 amounts to 257 billion, right? </p><p>And when there was some popular
unrest, they decided to give them another 500 billion so as to provide some
benefits. Don’t you think that it is worth paying attention to this and maybe
it is better to cancel the pension reform? </p><p>We are spending a lot of money. We
have a deficit but are still spending so much. I think generally I have said
everything I wanted about the pension reform.</p><p>Wait a minute. I would like to say
happy New Year to Mr President and wish him strength, every success and all the best. </p><p>And, sorry guys, I would like to make one last point. Mr Peskov said that there was some information and I would
like to share it.</p><p>Instead of all the requests that
journalists want me to make, I will speak about the most important issue.</p><p>Mr President, please help. Vladislav
Shestakov has been sick for three years. He is from the Irkutsk Region, the city of Cheremkhovo. He simply needs to be transferred to Moscow.</p><p>People have raised money. Please
help us resolve this problem.

We discussed
this issue at a meeting with human rights activists at a Council meeting. It is
not because I want to dodge the question, I just skipped over it inadvertently.</p><p>With regard to Ponomaryov, the court
ruled based on calls for an unauthorised rally. I do not want to question court
decisions or the fairness of this particular ruling.</p><p>Now, regarding the sensitive issue of the pension reform. In the early and mid-2000s, and you are aware of my position, I said that I was strongly against raising the retirement age, and it
was impossible to do so back then.</p><p>I still believe this was the correct
position, because life expectancy was at a low of 65, and the number of workers
(the workers/non-workers ratio) was different and more or less acceptable.</p><p>Now, things have changed
dramatically. The point is not about the current shortages. The fact is that trends
are such that the number of workers is declining, while the number of non-working pensioners is on the rise.</p><p>You are right, we can leave this
issue unaddressed, and I said so in my remarks. We can forget about it for the next five to seven years; however, then the country will have to do it no
matter what, but it will have to be done abruptly, without a transition period,
or any easing of terms, including for women.</p><p>We will then have to act quickly,
that is the problem. If I did not see these trends, I would have never allowed
this to happen, but these are objective trends that cannot be ignored.</p><p>You know, I was well aware of how
people would react. No matter what arguments one can come up with, when a particular person’s interests are at stake, no one is delighted with the prospect. I was well aware that criticism would be coming both from the right
and the left.</p><p>We know what was done by the left. In their time, they dismantled the Soviet Union with their economic policy, and later,
in the 1990s, almost destroyed Russia. We would not be living in the Russian
Federation now. Instead, we would be left with Moscovia, or something like it.
We managed to keep the situation in check. Moreover, the country is getting stronger
and better.</p><p>This is an unpleasant and, clearly,
not a fun thing to do, but it has to be done nonetheless. To reiterate, if I was
not convinced that it would have to be done some time down the road, I would
have never allowed it to happen.</p><p>Now, regarding the specific questions
that you asked, including forest reserves, the school and the sports complex.
This, as you understand, requires separate consideration, as these are separate
issues.</p><p>I promise that I will definitely
look into them. I hope that Oleg Kozhemyako will do so as well. I am sure he can
hear me now. I want him to submit the corresponding information to me and report accordingly.</p><p>Regarding the transfer of the administrative centre to Vladivostok, [Presidential Envoy to the Far Eastern
Federal District] Trutnev raised this issue a very long time ago. Vladivostok
is doing very well and is really the centre of the region and, to a certain
extent, a centre of gravity, I mean with regard to neighbouring countries, so I think this is a well-grounded decision.</p><p><b>Sergei Milvit:</b>

pre-trial detention facilities and special penitentiaries has been reported
with frightening regularity lately.</p><p>I am now talking about the Sverdlovsk,
Chelyabinsk, Orenburg and Saratov regions, Khakassia and the Trans-Baikal Territory.
Then last summer, thanks to our colleagues at Novaya Gazeta, we learned about
atrocious torture at the Yaroslavl prison. </p><p>At the same time we hear the story of serial
killer Vyacheslav Tsepovyaz, who, while being held at a high-security prison,
was allowed the pleasure of eating crab, caviar and the like.</p><p>Don’t you think the Federal Penitentiary
Service desperately needs reforming – and this needs to be done right now?
Since I am clearly not the first to alert you to this problem, can you tell us what
is being done and who will be given this responsibility? </p><p>When will prisons in Russia stop being a place
for recreation for some people and a place where other people are subject to medieval torture? Because this is really too much, I mean the things that are
now happening at federal penitentiaries. This is really too much even for our
country. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> The situation at the prisons must
constantly be overseen by the prosecutor’s offices, first of all. Clearly, the incidents
that are being reported are absolutely unacceptable. </p><p>Any violation of the law, to say nothing of torture, is a crime. Those who violate the law, who commit these crimes must be
held responsible. Incidentally, this is what happens when these kinds of stories come to light, in part, thanks to the media. </p><p>But it would also be incorrect to say that we
need to destroy the whole system. We should improve the system and bring public
oversight to a new level – I completely agree with this.</p><p> In connection with this, I would like to remind you
that we have established commissions that must work on this and which will
receive support from the Government and the President. I expect them to play a positive role in resolving the problems that the system definitely has. </p><p><b>Rustam Falyakhov:</b> Gazeta.Ru, I am Rustam Falyakhov, good afternoon.</p><p>Mr President, when you opened the press conference, you summed up macroeconomic results and it seems we are
living increasingly better. Paris residents might just be very jealous if we
believe the statistics.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Native residents of Paris are moving to the suburbs for a number of reasons. This is why a hike in petrol prices caused such discontent, many
native Parisians moved to the suburbs and higher petrol prices are very hard on their budgets. But this is a different issue.</p><p>Let us speak about housing
construction.</p><p>Go ahead, please.</p><p><b>Rustam Falyahov:</b> I have a question about the accuracy of statistics, the accuracy of the information used to measure the standard of living in Russia. If we believe the Government reports, incomes are growing, you also gave the number of half a percent. </p><p>Incomes are rising whereas prices
are falling. When Russians see price tags on goods and services, they
understand that government officials are just playing loose with the numbers. I am speaking about the statistics from the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Finance Ministry and others. </p><p>Experts are also bewildered as their
numbers and their data do not conform to official statistical data, and apparently,
desperate experts are already proposing to introduce a somewhat exotic
happiness index, which would take into account the voice of the Russians.</p><p>My question is very simple – is it
time to fine-tune official statistics? Otherwise, the May Executive Order will
be fulfilled easily whereas the happiness index will stand at zero.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I understand and partly share your concern, but only partly in the sense that it should be explained to people where the numbers come from and what
they mean, and how they should be taken.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/xIfyJ38nRxmpcy60fGmGoQbjG7ShS8dq.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/0SxCX5tSdPqk7NZmGEJcpKmdRMt33zL5.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(22, 42, 164);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #162aa4 0%, rgba(22,42,164,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #54352d 0%, rgba(84,53,45,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #496cc8 0%, rgba(73,108,200,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #33407e 0%, rgba(51,64,126,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p>Because when pure numbers are

months there was a 7.4 percent increase, and that by the end of the year it
will be 6.9 percent. But people will see this and say, “I have had no such
increase.”</p><p>This is an average. It concerns
certain sectors and certain regions. Somewhere there is an increase in a certain sector, for example, for oil workers or steel workers. And in some
cases, there is no increase. These are average figures. That’s the point.</p><p>Among the most important
indicators are the disposable income of the population and retail sales numbers.
This more or less conforms with the real state of affairs. And what is this
like? </p><p>In 2015, we had an over-2-percent
drop in the real disposable income of the population, in 2016 – minus 5.8, and in 2017 – 1.2, but also on the minus side. This is the disposable income of the population.</p><p>Incidentally, analysts certainly
understand what I am talking about. But for the majority of people it’s
unclear. Let me explain what it means and how these figures are calculated, it
will take 30 seconds. </p><p>It is fairly easy to calculate
people's expenses: how and where they spend money and how much. In other words,
if people spent money, they had it. Added to this are bank deposits and cash
savings. This is, on the whole, a calculable sum, because it is more or less
clear how much money people keep in banks. The Central Bank, which regulates
the money supply, is aware of the total amount: how much is kept in banks, how
much is in the hands of consumers. Cash savings in foreign currencies are
harder to calculate. But this is basically clear. Then the taxes paid by an individual (personal income tax, or property tax if there is any property) are
deducted, and then the figures are adjusted for inflation.</p><p>These are the disposable
incomes of the population. Again, they had been falling in our country in these
years. And only now, by the end of this year, we may have a 0.1-percent
increase, but only if we do not take
into account the lump-sum payments of 5,000 rubles to pensioners at the end of 2017. </p><p>So, the trend is
generally positive, and it is backed up by other data. What data? Sales volumes – sales are picking up. Despite some problems in the auto industry itself, car
sales have grown 27 percent.</p><p>As I said, the production of clothing and footwear has increased, food production is up 13
percent compared with the previous increase of 9 percent.</p><p>The volume of international air transportation has surged 46 percent, while domestic air travel
has grown by more than 20 percent. These are all signs of growing consumer purchasing
power. It is gradual and cautious, but it has been recovering. </p><p> It seems to me that if we explain this to people
in normal human language and show it as a whole, it will become clearer where
we are and where we are going. But this system undoubtedly needs to be
improved, I completely agree with you.</p><p>It is difficult for me to decide… The one with the Russian flag – by all means.</p><p><b>Yelena Yeskina: </b>Thank you very much Mr President, first of all from the cameramen

like to know what you think of Ataturk as a person and his historic role in global policy. Looking back at Ataturk, how will you assess today’s progress in relations between Russia and Turkey? </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Ataturk is certainly an outstanding
figure in Turkish history. He made an extraordinary contribution to the efforts
to preserve and restore Turkey as a state, he did quite a lot to achieve this.</p><p>He was a great friend of Russia, we know this,
and he cooperated with Russia, worked with it and we appreciate his input very
much.</p><p>Ataturk created modern Turkey, having laid the foundation for the state. This is what I think of him. </p><p>As for the status of our relations today, I think we should be satisfied with the progress in the development of ties
between Russia and Turkey in the economy and on security issues. Although our
interests have not always coincided on some matters, we have managed to make
compromise decisions on how to resolve the Syria crisis.</p><p>We respect the national interests of the Turkish Republic and the Turkish people in this area, and we see that our
Turkish partners are willing to compromise and so together we make these
compromise decisions to secure the development of a favourable situation in Syria and for the sake of fighting terrorism and strengthening our
relations. </p><p>As for the economy, you can see yourself that
our ties are growing stronger. Despite Turkey being a NATO member country, it
delivers on its commitments, as far as we can see. At the same time, being a NATO member it is pursuing an independent foreign policy. </p><p>We appreciate this, as it creates conditions
for maintaining predictable and healthy relations. Of course, in this sense,
the role of the incumbent Turkish President is great. Hopefully, this trend will
continue under the leadership of Mr Erdogan.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b>

First of all, what advantages and disadvantages can we expect from this? What currency
will the Eurasian Economic Union countries now use to pay each other – will
they adopt an interstate currency or use new digital technologies such as blockchain?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> A very important and interesting question. About dollarisation and weaning
the economy off the dollar, including the Russian economy.</p><p>In general, according to the IMF,
payments in dollars have slightly decreased around the world. The year before
last, they were a little over 63 percent I think, and now slightly over 62. But
for Russia, this figure is higher, 69 percent.</p><p>This is due to the fact that our
main export products, primarily oil, are listed on world exchanges in dollars, and this is a large amount.</p><p>Our foreign exchange reserves in dollars are declining; only recently, we were holders of American securities
quoted in dollars in the amount of $104 billion, now down to $14.4 billion. Payments
in yen and pounds have slightly grown in world trade.</p><p>As for weaning Russia off the dollar,
it will exclusively concern settlements between economic entities, but will in no way affect citizens.</p><p>When we were discussing today's news
conference yesterday, Mr Peskov told me that they are removing exchange rate ads
in some cities, including Moscow, and people are wondering about the reason behind
this, whether this may be connected with some restrictions on using dollars.</p><p> There is nothing of the kind, and it will not
happen, I would like to reassure everyone. Advertising exchange rates on currency exchange offices is only connected with one thing: the fight against
illegal money exchange businesses. This is about streamlining the sphere of finance, money circulation, and cracking down on grey businesses operating in this area, nothing more.</p><p>Regarding the ruble. Yes, use of the ruble as a reserve currency in transactions is growing, maybe not a lot, but it
is growing, primarily in transactions between the EAEU countries and in the post-Soviet space. </p><p>For example, use of the ruble has
grown significantly in transactions between Russia and Belarus, reaching, if I’m
correct, over 60 percent, almost 70 percent in clearing transactions while the numbers in cash settlements are smaller. But the role of the ruble will
certainly increase in this segment, that’s obvious. </p><p>It’s more reliable and does not
involve extra costs, especially the costs associated with dollar transactions.
Because you and I know perfectly well: wherever clearing operations are made,
they all go through US banks. </p><p>And if there are restrictions, it
makes you want to sidestep these restrictions which is a natural reaction. This
is happening around the world, by the way, in view of instability with these transactions.
</p><p>However, several issues must be
resolved for the ruble to be used at least as a regional currency. First,
cutting volatility. The exchange rate must be stable, and we have generally managed
to maintain it recently.</p><p>This is related to the activities of the Central Bank and the Government of the Russian Federation. As you have seen,
it is stable; it has somewhat lost its dependency on fuel and oil price
fluctuations partly due to the introduction of a floating exchange rate for the ruble.</p><p>This is the first goal. But we have
to ensure further stability and keep inflation low. This is an extremely
important condition.</p><p> Then comes the next step – we have to develop the financial infrastructure for transactions in the ruble. It is clear what this means.
We need to improve the settlement mechanisms between economic parties and financial institutions. We will be working on this.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/C4AjTfI4ufvviqyq7edroF2yVaYd302R.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/A5EMAcxgONK0zH0gKBA7ARPMyWtlksnE.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(13, 21, 32);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #0d1520 0%, rgba(13,21,32,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #46709f 0%, rgba(70,112,159,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #ffffcb 0%, rgba(255,255,203,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #a53532 0%, rgba(165,53,50,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b>
Mr Putin, perhaps you will take a question from foreign media. I can see <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> here.</p><p><b>Ann Maria Simmons:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President. Thank you very much for the opportunity
to ask you a question.</p><p>In the West, many politicians,
experts and even ordinary people see Russia as a great threat. They even think
that you, as the President of Russia, want to rule the world.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Well, of course.</p><p><b>Ann Maria Simmons:</b> I want to know if you really want this. Also, please, what is the real
goal of your foreign policy? Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> With regard to ruling the world, we know where the headquarters that is
trying to do so is located, and it is not in Moscow. However, this is related
to the leading role of the United States in the global economy and defence
spending: the United States is spending over $700 billion on defence, while we spend
only $46 billion.</p><p>Just think of it, we have 146
million people in Russia, whereas the NATO countries’ population is 600
million, and you think our goal is to rule the world? This is a cliché imposed
on public opinion in Western countries in order to resolve intra-bloc and domestic political issues.</p><p>When I say intra-bloc, I mean that
in order for NATO to rally countries around itself, it needs an external threat.
It does not work otherwise. You have to have someone to rally against. As a major nuclear power, Russia fits the bill perfectly.</p><p>With regard to domestic political issues,
unfortunately, Russophobia continues to flourish in many countries, especially
in Eastern Europe. For what purpose? In order to use old historical fears to ensure
their own domestic political well-being.</p><p>This is also harmful, because,
ultimately, it is about exploiting the phobias of the past, which prevent us
from moving forward. It is harmful for the countries and peoples whose leaders
are trying to pursue such a policy.</p><p>In fact, the main goal of our
foreign policy is to provide favourable conditions for the Russian Federation,
its economy and social sphere, to ensure unfettered movement forward and to strengthen our country from the inside, above all, so that it can take its
rightful place in the international arena as an equal among equals.</p><p> We are in favour of consolidating the system of international
law, ensuring unconditional compliance with the UN Charter, and using this
platform to develop equal relations with all the participants of international affairs.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov: </b>Mr President, you promised to talk about housing equity holders. Who

attention to housing equity holders that have been cheated: in St Petersburg,
the Leningrad Region and all across Russia.</p><p>What is happening now? Unfinished
buildings that do not comply with building equity contracts are being
commissioned in St Petersburg just to report to Moscow that everything is fine.
You see, during your Direct Line on June 15, 2017, Albin and Minenko, a federal
inspector, stood in front of my house, which had not been finished;
construction was ongoing, but they officially declared the building commissioned,
thus committing a criminal offence. But, you see, activists like me are being
bullied for taking this position. They are trying to open a criminal case
against me, because I am trying to write the truth about the officials.</p><p> My husband was killed on October 6, 2015. The investigation has not made any progress. Over the first 18 months they have
made my life a nightmare, as well as the lives of my family, because someone
leaked information to mass media. My mother passed away when she heard about
this from a television report. Can you see what is happening in St Petersburg?
My car was burned before that. All of this is happening in our hometown, our St
Petersburg. Please, I am begging you to look into this case, to look into housing
equity holders not only in St Petersburg, but in the Leningrad Region and everywhere in Russia.</p><p>I do not know. Let us, together with
you… We are just like you, we do not bite. Come to St Petersburg and meet our activists.
We will tell you the truth. We will tell you everything as it is, without these
fake reports and road maps, without these useless scraps of paper published by these officials on their websites all over the country. I communicate with equity
holders practically from all regions. We have a large group of activists. I have a pressing request. This is not even a question but a cry for help: please
help the cheated equity holders and on the investigation of my husband’s case.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Do you think your husband’s murder was related to your activities to protect
the interests of equity holders? </p><p><b>Alla Andreyeva:</b> Yes, this is the only connection I can see.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Is that so? I promise you to pay attention to this by all means. Do not
have any doubts about this. This is the first thing I will say.</p><p>The second is about the problem you
raised, it is very urgent indeed. This gives me an opportunity to speak in greater
detail about the problem and the construction industry. You know, this will
never end if we do not sort out the mess and switch to civilised ways of housing construction. Indeed, the real estate industry is faced with the task
of building 120 million square metres of housing but we must stop the practice
of attracting people’s money and irresponsibly spending it. </p><p>This is what happens: yes, we keep the cost of housing relatively low
but at the expense of what? Because some people acquire this housing at relatively low prices. In particular, this is also done at the expense of the people whose money is taken but who do not receive anything – either money or housing. This is the root of the problem and all evil. So we must certainly switch to civilised ways
of funding this industry even if this leads to a certain reduction in the construction
sector and some increase in prices. But without this we will never be able to put things in order there.</p><p>We must switch to bank financing, to normal and civilised loans or else
this will never end. The people who found themselves in a difficult situation
because they paid the money but received no housing must certainly be helped.
We should not shut our eyes to the scale of this problem. It is clear and I agree with you that even the figures that are now shown, the figures on cheated
equity holders and their personal problems do not click with reality. In fact,
the problem is even more urgent than these documents show.</p><p>As for the situation you described in your question, I do not know these
buildings of course, but we will see. I will also talk to the Acting Governor of this region, Mr Beglov. He is a very experienced man and can figure this out. I hope the situation will improve. In any case, be sure that this will be a subject
of my conversation with him. The first thing that will happen is that he will meet
with you.</p><p>Colleagues, listen to me. If we want
to go on a little longer, we must not turn our press conference into an unauthorised rally. OK? Let us not. So I ask you to calm down.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b>

a standoff of the Anglo-Saxon world.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> That’s great! “Would you like to meet?” “Will there be a meeting?” “Everyone will die.”</p><p><b>Marina Kim:</b>
I will explain. There was a standoff between the Anglo-Saxon world and the Russian
world in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. Have the rules changed now or is it the same game? Thank you very much. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Unfortunately, we see that many birthmarks of the past, as Karl Marx
used to say, are still there, but I hope that some things will somehow be made
right. Ultimately we will reach the bottom in our relations and will understand
that we have to go up, to push off from that bottom, go up, take a lungful of fresh air and with a clear head start thinking how to proceed. </p><p> I do not know if we have a meeting or not, I said a number of times that we are ready. We believe there are issues that we have to discuss together. Work at the expert level on Syria, for example, is ongoing.
We also have to speak about North Korea, and Afghanistan, a great many other
situations in the world.</p><p>After all, we need to talk about
bilateral relations; we are interested in this, as well as our American
partners are, by the way. Of course, there is no super-global interest. Our
mutual trade stands at a meagre 28 billion, or even lower now, less than 28, 25
to 27 billion maybe. This is nothing, zero. With China, we will reach 100
billion this year, and with the US, everything is in decline. Who is interested
in this? No one, not even the President of the United States, who is promoting
the idea of reviving the economy, as he says, in his quest to make America
great again.</p><p>I certainly believe that working
with Russia is important in itself, and this includes economic cooperation, at least bearing in mind that we play a key role in the global energy market; cooperation
in the field of nonproliferation and global security also matters, among other
things. We have a lot to talk about. But we see what is happening there. Now
power will change in Congress. Almost certainly, 100 percent sure, there will
be new attacks on the current President. Under these conditions, whether he will
be able to achieve any kind of direct dialogue with Russia, I do not know; you
will have to ask them.</p><p>What worries me though? You mentioned
the Anglo-Saxon world, where some deep-rooted, tectonic changes are occurring.
After all, please note, Trump won – this is an obvious fact no one seems to be
arguing with, but they do not want to recognise his victory either. This actually
shows disrespect for the voters – refusing to recognise his victory, doing
everything to delegitimise the incumbent President.</p><p> The same applies to Britain: Brexit got the majority vote – but no one wants to implement it. What are they refusing to recognise? The referendum results. Democratic procedures are being dropped out
of the equation, and destroyed; their value is being destroyed. That is what is
happening there. This is a serious process. I have pointed out that Western analysts
are already discussing this matter, both in the States, by the way, and in Britain. We must keep this in mind. But whatever happens, we still need to build bilateral relations. We are willing to. As soon as possible. As soon as the other side is ready, we will do this.</p><p>This one. [Sign] “How’s the health?”

Mr President, you have not taken any sports-related questions so far. Will you
take one from <i>Sovietsky Sport</i>?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Fine. There is something about a pike. What is up with the pike?</p><p><b>Nikolai Yaremenko:</b> Good afternoon, Nikolai Yaremenko, <i>Sovietsky
Sport</i>.</p><p>There are many sporting events, but I have only one question. I will not mention the World Cup, which we hosted brilliantly (strangely, no one has mentioned it today), nor
will I say anything about Mutko leaving football forever yesterday, or even the upcoming 95<sup>th</sup> anniversary of our newspaper and our hope to see you as a guest in our editorial offices.</p><p>I have a quick question about doping
which is a longstanding issue. It appears that this has long since become a political matter. Similar to the sanctions, international sports organisations seem
willing to take a bite at us whenever they get the chance.</p><p>On the other hand, this is a comfortable position for many of our sports officials as they can sit on their
hands and blame everything on politics. Do you think we are now clean enough in this area to be able to say that everything is fine now?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> First of all, to a large extent, we ourselves are to blame for this
situation, because our athletes did use doping.</p><p>It is a different matter that we were
accused of authorising the use of doping at the state level. This is not true,
and it has never happened and will never happen, because we must keep in mind
not only the results, which, of course are important, but also the health of our athletes.</p><p>However, since this has happened, we
must, first, acknowledge it and, second, admit our fault, which means that we were
unable to properly control doping. This is the responsibility of the organisations
and government agencies that were supposed to do this.</p><p>With regard to whether we have
stopped this or not, probably not, not 100 percent. Enormous efforts were made,
and a good framework was created to do it properly and to make sure it was done
with integrity.</p><p>But this is not just our scourge; doping
is used around the world. Nevertheless, we must strive to reduce it completely.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/MhwtCMsH5JTWcw5Sg3TK1X1CjyMrj71T.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/vSA15TdWw3mvRBP6Bat9S5lWqFbjkPJM.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(21, 62, 250);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #153efa 0%, rgba(21,62,250,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #8f8985 0%, rgba(143,137,133,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #4f214a 0%, rgba(79,33,74,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #eeb4c1 0%, rgba(238,180,193,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p> The WADA commission is currently working in our
country. They are holding talks with the Ministry of Sport, including on access
to related materials. But you are right about the political aspect of it, which
I hope will be overcome completely as well.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov</b>:
Mr President, we have been working for quite a while, almost three and a half
hours. And so I have a suggestion. There are three veteran journalists from the national level – Terekhov from Interfax, Gamov from Komsomolskaya Pravda and Kondratyev from NTV television channel. I suggest wraping up by taking three
questions from them.</p><p>Go ahead, Mr Terekhov.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Yes, but let several other colleagues ask their questions too.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov</b>:
Since you are the most experienced you must express yourself in a few words. </p><p><b>Vyacheslav Terekhov</b>: Absolutely.</p><p>In the very beginning you spoke
about health, medications, healthcare and the like. In many respects our health
depends on medications. Could you please tell us to what extent we are
independent of foreign supplies as regards medications? How do our medications compare
with their foreign counterparts in efficacy and who is responsible for the fact
that our analogues are even worse than planned? </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
You know, we must put things right here in many respects and counter the assertions
you just made. You asked: Who is responsible for the inferior quality of our
medications compared to their foreign counterparts? This is not true, they are
in no way inferior, however we must combat certain things in several areas. </p><p>Doctors that prescribe these
medications should cooperate less with producers and think more about their
patients. Do you understand? Because when they cooperate with specific
producers they say: “Ours are worse – take this imported one.”</p><p>But this does not mean that we
should get rid of all imported medications. If a certain medication is required,
it should be prescribed. This is a sensitive process but it is important to understand what the problem is in all respects.</p><p>Now I will say a few words about the scale. First, we have even started to export our medications. This year we will
export 700 million worth of medications. This is not so much but still a considerable amount – 700 million.</p><p>If we look at price tags, 30 percent
of medications are produced at home for the domestic market. They are 60
percent of the range. </p><p>As for our dependence or independence,
everything is interrelated in this world. That said we produce, say, 80 percent
of vital medications. Importantly, there are an increasing number of substances
produced in Russia, not simply generics that are brought in from abroad. On the whole, this programme is working. I believe it was launched in 2015 and will be
carried out until 2020. </p><p> As for the development of the pharmaceutical and medical industry, it is working. About 200 billion rubles are allocated for it
and it is fairly effective on the whole. This is a very important area of our
work and we will certainly continue it. </p><p><b>Alexander Gamov:</b> <i>Komsomolskaya Pravda</i> website,

because we have nice numbers, truthful numbers, they are real, they do not raise
doubts among experts, I think. Meanwhile, ordinary people do not quite trust
them because life is hard in Russia. This is my first point.</p><p>The second. There is no peace, I do
not mean the situation itself, but in people’s hearts, souls, minds, and thoughts.
In other words, people worry a lot about both you and the country. So why does
this happen? I believe that the middle tier official, the top tier, ministers,
governors – they are all afraid of Putin. You have appointed everyone, lined
them up, there are basically all normal people. Whereas those officials who want
to talk about an excise tax on sausage, or the Kremlin banning births or whatever, they muddy the waters and make it harder for people to believe Putin,
the state and so on. I think some sort of reform is needed. We must do
something with this middle tier. Let us retrain them, and let us help you.</p><p>To conclude, literally just before
the press conference I got a telephone message, a very short one, “Gamov, ask
Vladimir Putin if it is time to look into the disastrous gap between the incomes of top managers and ordinary people? When will the President finally make
a clear statement about it?” Because you have revisted that topic several
times.</p><p>Thank you very much.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> The point you are making is an eternal Russian
argument: The Tsar is good while the courtiers are thieves and outlaws. You
see, if something does not go well, it is everyone’s fault. This is my first
point. And secondly, as I have already said, the point is not that the numbers are
somehow wrong. The point is that they do not work well with the numbers. They
do not explain the numbers to the people. Whereas you said that the numbers are
good but they are not trusted. As if you failed to hear what I said in the beginning and in the middle, when I gave data related to a decline in the real
disposable incomes of the population. What is good about that? I did not say it
was good. Incomes fell in the country in 2015 while in 2016 they were down by 5.8 percent. What is good about that? And I did not say it was good, I said the trend is righting itself, thank God, and it is an objective factor. I do not
think that people here do not believe it. These are truthful things, and I hope
people do understand that.</p><p>Speaking about officials in general,
you, of course, know that there are people who have no idea what they are
saying. They are not where they should be and are not careful with their words.
There are people like this. But this is what we all are, our environment. That
kind of person was just someone yesterday and is an official now, so they can
blab. They are not ready. This means they are simply not ready for the job.</p><p>And, of course, we must work with
people, with all the officials. There are many good and active people among
them, too. This is a fact, we should accept this. You see, it is impossible to close
everything and then open the box to make it right. It is not a coincidence that
Moses and the Jews wandered in the desert for 40 years. Well, we cannot lead
146 million people across the desert for so long.</p><p>This is a process of growing up for the civil service. We are working with it; see, we are organising various
contests for young people. We have a human resources contest, Leaders of Russia. We teach them later at our academy. I believe 12 or 15 graduates have
already become governors, two are federal ministers and five or six are deputy
ministers. Little by little we will be expanding this. It is a long process.</p><p><b>Alexander Gamov: </b>You have not talked about the gap.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Speaking about the gap. First, unfortunately, it does exist. </p><p>Second, which is also unfortunate,
as rule, this is a global trend. In any case, this is what is happening in large economies. Look what is happening in the US. Our US colleagues are
present here, they must read US analyses. The gap between those who earn a lot
and those who earn very little is expanding by their estimation. By the way,
the campaign of President Trump, the current president, noted this very
clearly. They used this in their campaign and turned out to be right.</p><p>Of course we must take this into
consideration. At the very least we must decrease the number of poor people.
This is true.</p><p>Is that all?</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/ivTK0QtvTSRBBjoBkbyyrnA1UAn4WNA1.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/KmIhW9CCbAZZF7zGWNudCjeJfYxKHjS7.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(82, 65, 57);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #524139 0%, rgba(82,65,57,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #79675c 0%, rgba(121,103,92,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #34201c 0%, rgba(52,32,28,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #b08781 0%, rgba(176,135,129,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Dmitry Peskov: </b>Mr President, we have a veteran to wrap things up. </p><p><b>Vladimir

kind of year was this in terms of emotions?

Certainly, the presidential election, as this is important for the whole country. And the World Cup, which also turned out to be important for the whole country and the world.</p><p>Ussuriysk, please go ahead.</p><p><b>Yekaterina Kharina:</b> Good afternoon, I am Yekaterina Kharina, <i>Telemix</i> TV Channel, Ussuriysk. </p><p>Mr President, last week you signed an executive order on moving the capital of the Far East from Khabarovsk
to Vladivostok.
I have a question about this: what plans does the Government have to strengthen
the regions in the Far East and in particular, of Primorye Territory? Will we
live to see the gasification of the entire region? And what do you think about
the merging of our territory with Sakhalin Region? </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>You see, the merging of any constituent entities in the Federation is a matter
for the entities of the Federation themselves according to current law. If
Sakhalin and Primorye Territory decide to unite, they can; they have to go
through their respective procedures in parliament or hold a referendum, whichever
is provided for in the regional legislation. But looking deeper, Sakhalin is a self-sustaining region, it provides a large
share of its own budget, and the average income of the population is higher
than in the Territory in general, but this is the internal business of the two
regions. That is my first point.</p><p>The second concerns development. We
have a complete programme, a package of measures to develop the Far East and Primorye Territory, a complete programme to establish favourable development
conditions in the Far East. This includes the well-known Priority Development
Areas, which is the ‘Far Eastern hectare’, the development of infrastructure,
ports, airports, it is support for exports, including, and primarily, non-energy
exports. We will do all this; it will never disappear. On the contrary, all of this will be actively pursued. There must be no doubt about it whatsoever. This
will offer us an additional competitive edge.</p><p>We will definitely develop science
and education; we will keep supporting the Far Eastern Federal University. We will
certainly develop the shipbuilding sector and continue the construction of the shipyard
in Vladivostok. And you know, the first steps have already been taken for this,
and fairly big steps. Russia’s largest tonnage ships will be built in Vladivostok. We will build ships that are bigger than anything seen in the Soviet Union.</p><p> We will obviously continue our support for the aviation sector; plants will have contracts to keep busy, and research will be
developed. And a totally new sector has emerged – aerospace, the new Vostochny Space
Launch Centre. Marine biology, everything connected with fisheries – this will all
be a priority for us. I have no doubt that we will achieve positive results.</p><p>I promised Euronews. Go ahead, please.</p><p><b>Galina Polonskaya</b>: Hello, Mr President. Galina
Polonskaya, Euronews TV channel. Thank you for the opportunity to ask you a question. I will put down the sign, I have already become one with it during
these four hours.</p><p>The UN adopted a resolution about Russia’s
militarisation of the Sea of ​​Azov, Crimea, and part of the Black Sea. After
what happened with the Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait, there were reports
that Russia was sending military equipment to Crimea. Why should Russia
reinforce its military presence in Crimea? Is Russia ready to declare the entire water area of ​​the Sea of ​​Azov its territory? Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Look, in 2014, people living in Crimea came out for the referendum and ultimately voted for reunification with
the Russian Federation. From that moment, after the relevant domestic
procedures, Crimea became part of the Russian Federation, part of Russia. Therefore,
we are entitled to and will continue to pursue our military policy on any part
of our territory, as we see fit to ensure national security. Crimea is no exception.
If the General Staff, if the border guards believe that we need to do something
extra in some area, we will do it. Russia's security in this area will
certainly be ensured. We are not going to overdo it there, but what needs to be
done, will be done. This is the first point.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/pDvawTK8s6N48SgS5V4AIp2AMTZikc5r.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/AJrPdtRfK8kvWMAbNYRigKzRlFHJLOhB.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(198, 217, 232);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #c6d9e8 0%, rgba(198,217,232,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #6d5552 0%, rgba(109,85,82,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #9ea4a8 0%, rgba(158,164,168,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #183051 0%, rgba(24,48,81,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p>Now about the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait.
We almost immediately announced that we intended to build a bridge to link up with
Crimea, which we did. First we built an energy bridge, then a gas pipe, and now
we are building two power plants there, in Sevastopol and in Simferopol, with a total capacity of 940 megawatts. We are building the Tavrida road, to be
completed by the end of 2020. Next year, I think, the two-lane road will open,
and by the end of 2020, a four-lane road.</p><p> We will develop the local infrastructure. That is,
it is not only about reinforcing the military component, but above all, the civilian, infrastructure component. All this will certainly be implemented. We
have a federal targeted programme for the development of Crimea. For the next
two years, we have allocated 300 billion rubles for the development of the peninsula. All this will progress. Along with that, the military component will
be strengthened, as far as we need it.</p><p>As for the Kerch straits, the situation is difficult, in terms of nature. These straits are very narrow and rather shallow. Their depth is about 13 metres. Let me emphasise that pilotage
has always been conducted there. The construction of the bridge does not
interfere with anything. Pilots escort ships as they used to.</p><p>Freight turnover is growing, in particular, in the ports of the Sea of Azov, this is true. But work there is
organised and all participants in these economic activities know how this is
being done. There is a queue there. Sometimes it is bigger and sometimes it is smaller.
Just look at the number of vessels in front of the entrance to the port of Novorossiysk. There are quite a few of them. </p><p>I will have to repeat this once again: On September 11 of the past year Ukrainian
vessels, including warships, fulfilled all requirements of passage through these
straits and under the bridge and were calmly led by our pilots into the Sea of Azov
and further on to their destination in the Sea. Nobody interfered with them – just helped.</p><p>This time everything was different. This is a deliberate provocation in the course of Mr Poroshenko’s election campaign. We
have already shown in the media the logbook that contains the order to “enter
secretly.” What does “secretly” mean? Nobody can say what might happen there
without pilotage, all the more so when some politicians say in public that they
are ready to blow up the bridge. Naturally, we cannot allow this to happen.
This would be simply absurd for us, period. As for routine activities, nobody
restricts them.</p><p>Now a few words about the regime in the Sea of Azov. We have a treaty dating back to 2003, I think. What does it
say? It reads that there is a coastal area of five kilometres, not the usual 12
sea miles in accordance with the international Law of the Sea, but five
kilometres off the coast. These are the territorial waters of a state, in this
case of Russia or Ukraine, and the rest is common sea. Incidentally, our fishermen
were once captured although they did not enter the five km zone. Nonetheless,
they were seized and their captain is still detained. And your Euronews channel
does not even mention this as if this is how it should be. The same is true of other Russian seamen: there is a dry-cargo vessel with its crew out there
somewhere, but nobody recalls anything. Therefore, we should observe these
agreements and abstain from announcing any unilateral actions. </p><p>As for warships, they should be in constant contact with our border guards. The border guards conduct their border
mission. In conditions of martial law, I can hardly imagine warships going to and fro, but in general we would like to normalise the situation. We do not create
any obstacles to vessels, including warships. Let me repeat that last September
vessels were led by our pilot and nobody interfered with them, on the contrary
we only helped.</p><p>This is a complicated problem, which
we will certainly keep working on. You are right about this, I agree.</p><p>As far as the amendments to the Constitution are concerned, this is a matter for broad public discussion.</p><p><b>Dmitry Peskov:</b>

The press conference has been going on for over three hours, and only
the front rows and middle rows…</p><p>I have a personal request. We have
guests from Latin America here. During each break they keep yelling “Latin America,”
but no one is paying attention. If
possible, will you please give them the floor after me; they have come a long
way.</p><p>And now, properly, Mr President,
just a second. I have already forgotten what I was going to say.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Let’s talk to the people from Latin America then.</p><p><b>Khamzat Batukayev:</b> This is a serious subject, in fact. I wrote “Russians in Danger”
because thousands of our compatriots are still in Syria. They are there for one
reason or another, but there are also children who are not there by choice.</p><p>Their parents have been sentenced to long prison terms, maybe even life terms. The children are left without
parents, without care, and there are many such cases. How can we bring them
back? We know your principled position on the issue, so the question is how can
we proceed with this? </p><p>And, if I may, a second brief
question. One of the first requests from the first president of the Chechen
Republic, Akhmad-Haji Kadyrov, that was addressed to you regarded the construction of the airport in Grozny, the restoration, to be exact.</p><p>It was restored, but ever since it has
been suspended in some technical phase, which means it was not completely finished.
Currently the republic’s government is holding discussions with various
ministries on the second stage and apparently, there are some problems.</p><p>How can this be completed?
Objectively, Chechnya is still developing, but we host hundreds of thousands of tourists, and the airport capacity is not sufficient.</p><p>And the last thing. You know Mr
President, we have a main avenue that is named in your honour. You might not be
aware that we are currently building the Vladimir Putin Judo Palace.</p><p>You always receive one of the highest percentage of votes in the region, I can honestly tell you that
Chechens have deep respect for you, this is why I would like to invite you
there.</p><p>You have also received an invitation
from Adygeya or Karachayevo-Circassia, so when you go there, you can also come
to the Chechen Republic as a second leg of your trip.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I cannot go to Chechnya on my way to or from. I must go there directly.
And I certainly will. This is the first thing.</p><p> Second, regarding the children. I believe this is a priority. We are engaged in this; we have a programme for repatriating these children
to their homeland, to Russia, Chechnya, to the Caucasus, wherever. And Ramzan
Kadyrov is also involved in this. We are doing this and will continue with it.</p><p><i>Ural</i>s, there
is a sign that says Urals.</p><p><b>Roman Zykov:</b>
Good afternoon.</p><p>My name is Zykov Roman, Urals
television.</p><p>Mr President, you say that
patriotism should be our national idea. Isn’t it time we codify this in law, amend
the Constitution to stipulate that patriotism is the national idea? Right now, a national idea is prohibited by of the Constitution. This is my first question.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/eRwDKAg7AxIgioGa1R5STkCVlnJqDTpq.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/GZHgCKnJ6vt4bWh4takbNudKqT9WG6h3.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(7, 66, 254);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #0742fe 0%, rgba(7,66,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #a5d1cb 0%, rgba(165,209,203,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #39201f 0%, rgba(57,32,31,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #6c6291 0%, rgba(108,98,145,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2018-12-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Vladimir Putin’s annual news conference.</span> </div><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> It is ideology as a leading force that is prohibited, not patriotism. I hear you. This is a subject for a wide public discussion.</p><p><b>Roman Zykov:</b>
And the second question. We have spoken about active patriotism; now, I am
worried about the environment.</p><p>A lot of money is being allocated
for the purification of water, which then goes to consumers, but there is
practically no money allocated to maintain the quality of the pipes that deliver
it to consumers, and to ensure that the sewage does not pollute our nature.</p><p>Unfortunately, 30 percent of sewage
water pollutes nature – experts confirm this. Could you look into the issue and possibly adopt some technical regulations so that the quality of the pipes that
deliver water to consumers like you and me is higher and we do not pollute the surrounding waters?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> This is a question of technical regulations.</p><p>You are certainly right. We must
look into what is being supplied. I agree with you. It is a problem. But the problem
is not only the pipes.</p><p>The problem is in the discharge of wastewater, and its purification. This is an issue that affects the entire country.
But the relevant decisions have actually been taken here. This also applies to industry.</p><p>Applicable law provides for a transition to the latest available technologies. Penalties are imposed for the discharge of untreated water, and, generally, for waste, on companies that do not
comply with the environmental requirements.</p><p>As for the airport, when needed, it operates
as an international airport. If something more is needed, Mr Kadyrov will come
and tell me. I will see what needs to be done; I just do not see what else needs
to be done. The airport is functioning, but if we need to do more, we will see.
Will that do? And thank you for the invitation.</p><p><i>Friendship of Peoples</i> – over there, a young woman is standing in a kokoshnik. Yes, please,
give her the microphone.</p><p><b>Valeria Pavlyuchenko:</b> Mr President, good afternoon! My name is Valeria Pavlyuchenko; I am a representative of the First Russian ethnic TV channel.</p><p>I believe you know about our TV channel,

Dagestan, who spoke about ethnic and interethnic journalism.</p><p>We are a young team, let us say, a developing channel, and we report about the achievements of the regions, and interethnic
