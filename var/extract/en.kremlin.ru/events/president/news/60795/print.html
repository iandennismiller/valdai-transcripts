</div> <p><b>Tatyana Remezova:</b> Good afternoon.</p><p>As of now, we have received some 1.5 million
questions from the public. Actually, the figure exceeded 1.5 million this
morning. The most popular form of address is a telephone call. We have received nearly one million of them. Each call
is recorded and processed by operators and is presented in a special inquiry
form.</p><p>We have received nearly 400,000 text and MMS
messages. However, this year the people are very actively using the website
moskva-putinu.ru to ask their questions. It is very simple and easy to use.
People can make video calls, talk with an operator, send a text message or record a video message. This is very simple to do. Just click on the Record
button. The only condition is that your message must not exceed one minute. Now
click on the Send button. Your address will be processed by our staff. It means
that your message has reached us.</p><p>The benefit of sending a video message is that
you can tell us about your problem and also let us see it. It can be a bumpy
road, a rubbish heap or a leaking roof. We will be broadcasting live the messages about the most acute problems. </p><p>The OK Live service is another high-tech means
of reaching us. This service will connect you directly to us in this studio; we
will try and do this during this programme. Not a single call will remain
unanswered. Every call will be processed, and, as I have already said, summed
up in a special form that includes your contact information. The most important
part is that work on your calls will also continue after Direct Line.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Good afternoon. Mr President, shall
we begin?</p><p><b>President of Russia
Vladimir Putin:</b>
Good afternoon. Of course, let us proceed.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Over the past few days we saw for the first time how you prepare for Direct Line. We saw you sitting over a heap
of questions and reading other messages on your laptop. What looked like the most
important to you? What are the most acute problems?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: In fact, it is clear that I should
always be informed and aware of what is going on in reality. In the course of the current work it is more or less clear what people are concerned about. But
during the preparations for Direct Line, of course, we find out some things
that are the most pressing and important at that particular point. At the moment, and it is not a secret or a revelation, people are most concerned about
the quality of life, incomes and healthcare. These issues are followed by waste
treatment; this is what I heard just now. So, these are the most pressing
issues. Housing and utilities.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: It is true, we have received great
many questions regarding these issues, but there is something else. As I understand, these problems should be solved by national projects. Everyone talks
about them; officials at all levels talk about national projects. But, judging
by the questions, it seems that people do not quite understand what these national
projects are and what they are supposed to achieve. Will they be useful in the end?</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/EXdBA4dTjd0rKjtiTQpgRqafTu4XdFUK.JPG" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/L7RAGevAdko7qA10w9ahHbg2JhIvmaNK.JPG 2x" style="background:rgb(111, 81, 71);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #6f5147 0%, rgba(111,81,71,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #cef1ff 0%, rgba(206,241,255,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #0b80fd 0%, rgba(11,128,253,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #ea2069 0%, rgba(234,32,105,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Before the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Before the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Before the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Yes, of course, and I am grateful that you
chose to begin with this issue because all of our work revolves around it
today. In fact, the work revolves around people, but in order to achieve the best results for our people, for our citizens, for the development of the economy, we created these so-called national projects. The ultimate goal of national projects is to put the economy on new track, make it tech-intensive
and improve labour productivity, thus improving the quality of life and our
country’s long-term security. Therefore, we divided the areas of activity, not
by the level of importance, but in a certain order in accordance with the distribution
of resources.</p><p>It was a challenging job. First of all, we
needed to decide how we would attain the result set and where to find the funds
for the measures the state is supposed to finance.</p><p>Regrettably, one of the Government’s decisions
was to increase VAT from 18 to 20 percent. In part, it was done, as I have
already said, to replenish the budget and to start working on one of the state’s
obligations, that is, on infrastructure development.</p><p>For example, who will build railway lines,
bridges, motorways or electricity lines? None of this, as well as some other
structural jobs, can be done without the involvement of the state.</p><p>And then we coordinated the decision,
calculating how much we need in order to boost the development of certain
sectors and to increase people’s incomes to a new level.</p><p>I would like to say once again that,
regrettably, we had to take some unpleasant measures – let us put it this way.
But we believed from the very start that the relatively negative effects of these measures could and would be very short-lived. Overall, the Government and the Central Bank turned out to be right, alas – inflation increased for a period of six months. </p><p>What does this “inflation increased” mean? It
means that the Central Bank raised the key interest rate, it means that production
fell a little, and so on.</p><p>We can see now that production is on the rise
again, that inflation is declining – I believe it fell to below 5 percent as of the day before yesterday, and that incomes started growing…</p><p> We will talk about this in more detail later, of course, but it is true that incomes have started growing again. In other words,
our plans and the methods of implementing them appear to be effective, at least
so far.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Mr President, let us continue.</p><p>You have mentioned a decline in incomes. We all see it too. There are a lot of questions. I will read just a few very short ones, they are from different regions.</p><p>“Could you please tell us when life will get better, at least a little bit? It is very difficult to raise children with a salary of 10,000.” This is from Vladimir Nenashev, Samara Region.</p><p>Perm Territory: “Why are single-industry towns dying? We have two plants, but there is no work, young people either leave or take to drink. ”</p><p>Very, very many questions. I know that shortly before we went on air, a video question was sent in, so I am giving the floor to our call centre.</p><p><b>Natalya Yuryeva</b>: Thank you. We really have a lot of questions about low wages, which are simply impossible to live on. People cannot even afford essentials: food, clothes for themselves and their children. And, most often, the problems hit the ones that our lives depend on – teachers and doctors.</p><p>For example, a teacher of the highest category from Orel wrote to us that she makes 10,764 rubles a month; another teacher, also the highest category from the Tver Region, 15,000; and a doctor from Murmansk, about 20,000.</p><p>Stanislav Taukachiskas, a firefighter from the Kaliningrad Region, makes even less than that, as it turns out. We simply cannot help but show the video message that he sent to Direct Line.</p><p><b>Stanislav Taukachiskas</b>: Hello, Mr President,</p><p>My name is Stanislav Taukachiskas, I am from Svetly in the Kaliningrad Region.

At the moment, the salary of a firefighter is 12,000–13,000 rubles; as the squad leader, I make 16,000.</p><p>It is impossible to live on that, not with the current prices: we are forced to find two or three jobs and are hardly ever at home. Families are falling apart because of this.</p><p>Moreover, fire brigades are understaffed – two or three people on guard. You see what is happening now in the country: fields are burning, summer cottages, larger structures. When will this be sorted out?</p><p>Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> First of all, we should check what
you said about the 10,000 ruble wages. We must know what is really going on.
Why? Because we have recently decided to increase the minimum wage and raise it
to the subsistence level, which is 11,280 rubles.</p><p>Those who work full time must not be paid less
than the subsistence wage. I cannot understand why they only receive 10,000
rubles.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> They write that their salary is
10,000 rubles and that whatever they get above that, they receive as a bonus.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> People write that the minimum wage
has been reduced in some regions by regional authorities.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> In this case, it is a matter for the regulatory authorities to check up on. Or these people are working part-time.
Each particular case must be examined individually. This is the first thing I wanted to say.</p><p>Now to the problem at hand. Frankly, it is true
that the situation at the Emergencies Ministry is far from positive. Because
the wages of some of the Ministry’s uniformed personnel are small, just as this
person has said. I do not know if he is a military man, because a military man
doing his job would have earned some 43,000 rubles a month, while civilian
personnel only receive between 13,000 and 16,000 rubles.</p><p>Over the past few months, I discussed this
matter several times with [Emergencies] Minister [Yevgeny] Zinichev, who constantly
raised this question with the Government.</p><p>A decision has been taken: this year we will
allocate 4.3 billion rubles to the Emergencies Ministry so as to raise the wages of the ministry staff, such as the man who has written to us, to some
24,000 rubles.</p><p>Next year, we plan to allocate 4 billion rubles
every six months, or 8 billion altogether, so that this man’s salary should
increase to some 32,000 rubles.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> Let us ask if our call centre has
received any new calls.</p><p><b>Natalya Yuryeva:</b> Yes, we are swamped with calls;
there are more than 1.5 million of them. There is an incoming call from a pensioner. Where from? Moscow. And that caller has not yet given a name.</p><p> Colleagues, we have an incoming video call. We will
read out the question as soon as the caller formulates it.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>Yes, Natalya.</p><p>Let me get back to the decline in incomes. Over
this time, we have received thousands of messages saying that people are earning
less. Everyone writes that: those who have good wages, those who belong to the middle class and those who are not embarrassed to call themselves poor. And what
is probably important here is not the numbers as such but the way people feel.
People write that life has become more difficult. When will it get easier?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>This is true. This is why I consider
this issue to be one of the most relevant and important.</p><p>Let me remind you that several years ago we
faced several shocks. These are not just the external shocks from the so-called
sanctions or the current restrictions, but the situation on the market of our
traditional goods such as oil, oil products, gas, hydrocarbons in general,
metals, chemical fertilisers, chemistry in general and some other products as well.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/oEaOpJ6fHwBiCzEtWW6jofKbu9iRiCdl.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/KDqHtwFekHcdR6HBA8QAIJOgANZznZ7E.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(166, 183, 199);background:linear-gradient(0deg, #a6b7c7 0%, rgba(166,183,199,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #5595fe 0%, rgba(85,149,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #b3eff3 0%, rgba(179,239,243,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #7d746c 0%, rgba(125,116,108,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Before the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Before the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Before the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>This is why we can see this unpleasant element
in the economy and the social sphere. It is true that real incomes have been
declining for several years. The biggest decline took place in 2016, I believe.</p><p>Now incomes are gradually rising again. We
should distinguish
between two notions: people’s real disposable incomes
and wages.</p><p>Real disposable income, which, according to statistics, have been decreasing, is made up of many markers, including income
and expenses. Today, payments on loans is one of these markers, and banks
provide loans that amount to 40 percent of the wages, so to speak, which, of course, may have consequences.</p><p><b>Remark: </b>It is risky.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Yes, I agree, it is risky. The Central Bank must pay attention to it, because we do not need these bubbles in our economy. Nevertheless, people take out loans, and then they have to repay
them, which has a negative effect on real incomes.</p><p> About 100,000 self-employed individuals have registered
officially, the shadow market has decreased, and this also affects real
incomes. There are other factors as well; I will not list them all here.</p><p>Speaking of wages, we can see that
wages continue to increase both in nominal and real terms. In nominal terms, it
looks like this: in 2017, gross wage in the economy was slightly over 39,000 (39,200)
rubles, while this year, it is nearly 45,700, with the figure for the last
month standing at 48,500.</p><p>I would like to make a reservation straight
away, so that Internet users and television audience watching us now don’t get
angry that they don’t get such wages. This is natural, I am talking about
average figures. </p><p>Why do we have to use these average figures?
This is because the situation differs greatly, depending on the specific sector
or region. The people who are getting paid in Tyva are one thing, and those in Moscow, Tyumen or Ingushetia are another matter. </p><p>Speaking of various sectors, the oil
industry, the financial sphere and the transport sector pay different wages.
But the format of our meeting makes it impossible to discuss each sector and each region separately for three or five hours.</p><p>Therefore I and some other
colleagues have to use average figures that, nevertheless, show the overall
trend. What is this trend like? In the past, gross wages were just 33,000
rubles, and now the total is almost 45,000. </p><p>Real wages are calculated depending
on specific growth rates. In 2018, we saw 8.5 percent growth rates, and two
percent growth rates were posted in early 2019. The May 2019 growth rates are
estimated at 2.8 percent.</p><p>Why did we see such growth rates
last year? First, I believe this was due to economic recovery. Second, all levels
of government tried to fulfil the 2012 executive orders, and even in late 2018 they were adding and adding and adding.</p><p>By the way, some of the provisions
of the May 2012 executive orders may not have been fulfilled. But if it were
not for these documents, we would fail to achieve such results because the executive orders force all levels of government to work and achieve results, no
matter what. This is the second thing. </p><p>Third, as I have already said, we
have raised minimum wages to the minimum subsistence level. </p><p>By the way, initial wage increases
covered 44 million people. One way or another, 44 million people received large
or small wage rises. </p><p> Increasing minimum wages covered an additional 3.7 million people. This year, we will index the pay grades of service personnel.</p><p>There will certainly be questions about
pensions today, but I’ll say right now, because ensuring that retired citizens get
a sufficient income is one of the state’s priorities, of course, and we will
certainly keep an eye on it. This year, the indexation of the insurance old-age
pensions was 7.05 percent, with last year’s inflation at 4.3 percent. This is
the first point.</p><p>Secondly, starting from April 1, we raised state
pensions and social pensions by 2 percent following the increase of the subsistence minimum for pensioners. From October 1, retired military’s pensions
will be increased by 4.3 percent.</p><p>As I already said, this will be done along with
the increase in military compensations. On the whole, we are moving forward – we
can see this problem and will certainly deal with it and will focus on it.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Will life get easier, in general?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: You see, this is what all the national projects that I mentioned are aimed at. Actually, the general solution
to this problem is not government funds injected into industry or something
else.</p><p>The general way is to increase labour
productivity, to develop the economy, and on this basis increase and improve
the standard of living of the citizens – on the basis of growth. Everything else
is auxiliary, because where do you think the government gets the money from?
Also from the way the economy works.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/1Inkr3cu4Agcz3MUSGvAp9Z1gAMAX05X.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/evAJk9gaNA04SJwQbDAJM0NdUiNtjpVp.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(146, 180, 192);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #92b4c0 0%, rgba(146,180,192,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #2f375c 0%, rgba(47,55,92,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #d97069 0%, rgba(217,112,105,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #f8f0ee 0%, rgba(248,240,238,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Before the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Before the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Before the Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Mr President, let’s continue. </p><p>Another topic is healthcare, with a lot of questions.</p><p>On the one hand, everyone is talking about
progress, which is obvious; new medical centres are opening, including
high-tech ones. On the other hand, outpatient clinics are closing, and the quality of medical care does not always correspond to what the patients expect.</p><p>These are common problems for the whole
country. Therefore, our camera crews went to three places from where
people called Direct Line.</p><p> We have three regions with us via videoconference:
the Chelyabinsk Region, the Pskov and Smolensk regions.</p><p><b>Mikhail Akinchenko</b>: Mikhail Akinchenko, Roslavl,
Smolensk Region. We are standing in front of a children’s clinic.</p><p><b>Anton Vernitsky</b>: I am Anton Vernitsky, and I am

in front of the children’s clinic. First of all, a few words about this town. It
is an administrative centre of the district with a population of around 50,000
people. There is a hospital and two clinics: one for adults, one for children. We
received a complaint for Direct Line from a young mother, Svetlana Vekshina,
who is here next to me. Three and a half months ago she gave birth to a child,
a boy. By the way, we missed that point, what is the name of your son,
Svetlana?</p><p><b>Svetlana Vekshina</b>: Maxim.</p><p><b>Mikhail Akinchenko</b>: A great name. So, Maxim is quiet and does not speak but his mother has something to say.</p><p>Svetlana, could you tell us, please,
about the problems you encountered when you moved here from Moscow?</p><p><b>Svetlana Vekshina</b>: Hello,</p><p>During the initial examination in Moscow we were given a list of medical specialists that my son had to see on a stage-by-stage basis, as well as a list of examinations that we had to go
through once a month or once every two or three months.</p><p>We moved here and the first thing we
faced, regardless whether I had made an appointment to see a doctor, was the queues,
and children having to wait, sometimes for more than two hours. The first time
we went for our appointment, we had to wait for over two hours. And the second
thing is the absence of specialists, which is the most important thing as far
as I see it. So we could not make appointments, as per the list we were given,
to see doctors and go through the examinations from that list. The list of available examinations is very limited.</p><p><b>Mikhail Akinchenko</b>: And where do you go to see specialists,
if you need to? </p><p><b>Svetlana Vekshina</b>: Nowhere, so far. Well, maybe there is an option to go to Smolensk. But
Smolensk is a regional city and it takes two and a half hours to get there by coach.
First you need to get to the coach, then travel there by coach, and with a small child this is a very tiresome trip.</p><p><b>Mikhail Akinchenko:</b> On the whole, the situation is
clear but we would probably like to hear the alternative point of view as well.
We have come here and are right by the children’s clinic. Since we have come,
although without any warning, let us hear what the doctors have to say. By the way, it is Thursday today and on Thursdays, the clinic issues appointment slips to see
pediatric specialists. Today, there was a queue of people waiting for these
slips here, at the front desk. But now it is afternoon and there is no queue.
We do not see anyone but, theoretically, we should be able to get a slip today.
Let us ask the staff at the front desk. There is such a wonderful woman here.</p><p>Hello. Direct Line with Vladimir
Putin here. We are now on the air. Could you tell us please whether there
really are problems with doctors? Could you tell us which specialists people
are queuing to see? What is your name? Could you please introduce yourself? </p><p><b>Remark:</b> Marina.</p><p><b>Mikhail Akinchenko:</b> Marina, are there queues to see pediatric specialists?

clinics in Roslavl offer 60,000 rubles at the least, which means the wage gap
between the public and the private sector is huge.</p><p>Ms Mochalova, you can take your problem up with
the President. What would you like to ask him about the shortage of specialists?</p><p><b>Natalya Mochalova:</b> I would rather address my question
to the federal authorities. I am not sure, but graduates should probably be assigned to the regions after they graduate. Probably, this is the only solution
to this problem.</p><p><b>Mikhail Akinchenko:</b> Well, this is the issue we wanted
to raise. I hope its essence is more or less clear.</p><p> This was Roslavl.</p><p><b>Anton Vernitsky:</b> The Pskov Regional Oncology Centre
is a state-of-the-art healthcare facility that was renovated completely just
three years ago. In 2016, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was shown this
centre’s equipment. You see, it received the so-called heavy-duty equipment,
including CT scans, a computerised linear accelerator and gamma radiation
systems. The state invested almost 1.5 billion rubles in the centre’s reconstruction.
This is an expensive centre with expensive equipment. Mr President, three years
have passed and people from Pskov are complaining to Direct Line that it is
very hard to get an appointment with an oncologist, many people waiting in corridors, there are always queues, and people come here at 5am to get their
names on the waiting list. </p><p>Let’s ask the front desk.</p><p>Hello. I understand that you did not expect us
to come. Could you please tell me if you have a lot of people who come here to get an appointment? How many people came today? </p><p><b>Remark:</b> People come by appointment.</p><p><b>Anton Vernitsky:</b> And you do not have any problems

It was not just renovated; it features state-of-the-art equipment.
Unfortunately, Russia still has few such centres so far. </p><p>The doctors are now saying that they can show us

when congratulating medics on Medical Worker Day this past Sunday. Actually, he
said that 43 percent of vacancies in the region remain vacant.</p><p> The problem of this state-of-the-art centre has to be resolved. Anyone who can do so leaves for clinics in St Petersburg and Moscow, although this centre has modern equipment.

we help? </p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: Let us go over to the third city straight away.

Region, at the local paramedic centre. As you can see, they have a dentist’s
chair now, which is an incredible thing in itself. Because you can rarely find
a paramedic centre in a rural area, not to mention a dentist’s chair. This has
become a sort of a symbol of rebirth: the paramedic centre reopened here in February;
it had been closed for three years because there was a lack of funds and because the specialists who worked here were made redundant. </p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/Z29aQKtoifUMsQc3JLOssnhrwIAfRUxF.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/PY8H32D6JImDdhmBKhyI2JrgrXImLCTC.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(129, 110, 103);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #816e67 0%, rgba(129,110,103,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #2b52fa 0%, rgba(43,82,250,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #b3c3d9 0%, rgba(179,195,217,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #e63243 0%, rgba(230,50,67,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>The centre used to have four employees, and now
there are only two. Nevertheless, just the fact that they have access to a paramedic and a nurse, that a dentist comes once a month, is a huge support for local residents. Now pensioners, for example, do not need to travel 25
kilometres to the nearest town of Kasli, which is a very long way for them.</p><p>However, some negative aspects remain, because, for example,
physiotherapy is still not available because the equipment is too old. The biggest
problem, ultimately, is staff, the fact that young professionals do not come here, despite the fact that the Rural Doctor
programme has been launched. Svetlana is a paramedic, her shift ended two hours
ago, but she kindly agreed to talk with us.</p><p>Svetlana, could you please tell us do you agree
that the village needs young specialists
like doctors and paramedics? Why they do not come here?</p><p><b>Svetlana Katashova</b>: Good afternoon. I believe that the main
problem here is the shortage of housing in the village. There is no decent housing.
When specialists come here, they like our village, the nature here.</p><p><b>Dmitry Shchugorev</b>: So, they came?</p><p><b>Svetlana Katashova</b>: They did, yes. But they have one question:
where will we live? And there is no decent housing, they do not agree to live
in such conditions and so they go back. And we live here, we were born here.</p><p><b>Dmitry Shchugorev: </b>There are two people working here: you and your
assistant, the nurse, who works part time. How do you cope? Is it hard for just
the two of you?</p><p><b>Svetlana Katashova</b>: It gets hard sometimes, especially during the autumn and winter
period, when infection outbreaks start, like colds and flu. Of course, it can
get very hard.</p><p><b>Dmitry Shchugorev:</b> Thank you. It is an obvious and objective problem for many rural paramedic centres in Russia. We know that the regional government plans to increase the number of such centres by 100 within
three years. Of course, such problems must be taken into account because they
affect very many towns, especially small ones.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> Mr President, you can see the effect of Direct Line. Problems end as soon as Direct Line starts. But the shortage of personnel is a very real problem.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> It is.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> If you consider it necessary, we
have Healthcare Minister Veronika Skvortsova with us today.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, I see her. I will give her the floor later.</p><p>But first I would like to say the following.
When we speak about healthcare, we should remember that this sector is
improving, by and large, although it does have its problems, many problems,
just as any other sector that is directly concerned with the people, works with
and helps the people.</p><p>What are the main problems we must settle, and which problems should we focus on as a priority?</p><p>First, the availability of primary medical care.
You have mentioned rural paramedic centres here. I will speak about this later.</p><p>Second, specialists and the shortage of certain
specialists.</p><p>And third, the provision of medicine. These are
the three main problems. There are more problems, but I consider these the most
important ones.</p><p> First, regarding the situation with the availability
of primary medical care. It is true that we see the curtailment of the outpatient part of this service in some regions. The number of rural paramedic
centres has decreased by 2 percent, while the number of outpatient departments
has increased by 26 across the country. However, the share of primary medical
care, or more precisely the number of outpatient departments, has decreased
dramatically in some regions, in 15 to 18 regions. Some of them are quite
prosperous regions with experienced and effective management staff. </p><p>In the Krasnodar Territory, primary care has
been reduced by 25 percent across the region, the same as in the Chechen
Republic; the Kirov Region has also seen a significant reduction, although not
by as much as 25 percent. And all these regions are led by very competent and effective people. There are 15 other regions like that, 18 in total. I am asking
the Healthcare Minister to pay attention to this when talking to her colleagues
in the regions, and the leaders of these regions should also pay attention to this. This is the first point.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/bvxIX4or8gh1UY3jcLeVEc9B0t8zSMHw.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/TUfOV9BOgbqb5CbgPiUe6fkG86TUF6Rm.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(85, 87, 73);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #555749 0%, rgba(85,87,73,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #050f14 0%, rgba(5,15,20,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #cad5d0 0%, rgba(202,213,208,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #2496f9 0%, rgba(36,150,249,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>Secondly, we are talking about these rural
paramedic centres, they are very important, and should be supported of course. In the near future, 390 new centres are expected to be built and 1,200 existing
ones overhauled, but they require major repair work.</p><p>Furthermore, in small towns, a mobile medical
care system is being developed. I suppose as many as 3,800 mobile units have
been created, and over a period of the next few years, say in the next three
years maybe, about 1,200 more are expected to be launched. Equipment must be
procured for them, and teams need to be formed, and so on. This will all be
done towards ensuring the availability of primary healthcare.</p><p>It is definitely necessary to develop a system for district GPs, or village paramedics, so we pay, respectively, a million or 500,000
rubles, to those who want to go there and work as a county doctor or a county
paramedic.</p><p>A doctor from one of the regions has just
outlined one of the major problems – housing. This problem needs to be dealt
with. The federal government pays them a lump sum of 1 million or 500,000 [as a relocation allowance], but the matter of housing should be handled by the regional
and local authorities. We talked about this many times. And they should earmark
funds in their budgets for these purposes; otherwise, of course, people will
leave.</p><p>The next problem is personnel. Indeed, there is
still a shortage of staff – 25,000 doctors and 130,000 nurses. One of the key aspects
here, of course, is raising their wages. Again, I just heard now that the wages
are low. They are growing across the country; with doctors, this year’s growth
has brought their average monthly pay close to 77,000. This is for the whole
country, and Moscow and St Petersburg, there are high salaries there. But there
are regions where there are very low salaries, and we certainly need to level
this out. The same applies to nursing staff; there has been, I think, a growth
of 3.5 percent, to about 35,000, Ms Skvortsova can correct me, maybe around 39,000
is the average pay. Again, I repeat – this is the average for the entire country.
And for junior staff, growth was 2.2 percent, to 35,000, also an average. We
need to bear this in mind.</p><p> And medicine provision – this is, of course, an extremely important thing, especially for life-saving medicines.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> Very many questions concern subsidised medicines.
The people cannot receive vital and essential medicines, for some reason, for conditions such as diabetes or other diseases.
We will likely redirect this question to the Healthcare Minister.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I will give the floor to Ms
Skvortsova, but first of all I would like the people, especially in the regions, to listen to me, because there is a difference between what the Minister
says and what I say. </p><p>What is
it all about? Medicines are provided to people from two sources:
the federal centre and the regions.</p><p>The federal
funds allocated for this purpose were transferred to the regions in full back
in February, yet we see problems with the supply of some medicine. Besides, the situation differs depending on the illness, such as cancer or diabetes.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> There is also high blood pressure.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, the third ailment is high
blood pressure. The funds were transferred in full as well.</p><p>What do we
see? We see that many regions take too long to organise the purchasing
procedure, delay tenders and do not have a smooth information system even
within the boundaries of one region.</p><p>Take the Smolensk Region. Ms Skvortsova can tell you about it – she updated me barely
two days ago. Was it the Smolensk Region or not? I could be wrong; she knows
better. No, it was not Smolensk.</p><p>Well, we sent
an inspection team there. And what was discovered? The warehouses are filled up
with medicine, which is not reaching the people. Why? Because the distribution
system has no information about what is available in the warehouses. We need to streamline the information sector and adopt new methods of working with the people.</p><p>Now for the Thrifty Outpatient Clinic project. I have seen how it works in some regions,
and it does help to seriously improve the quality of the medical service. By the way, the number of patients in such clinics has greatly increased. This
idea has a huge potential.</p><p>As for the regions, part of the vital and essential medicine is purchased in the regions.
Regrettably, only seven regions buy the full list of medicine like this. In the rest of the regions the list of these vital medicines that people need is made
shorter, the necessary medication is not purchased. </p><p>There may be
many reasons for this, but I would like to point out that the regional
authorities must be aware of their priorities. It is one thing to launch a construction project, giving construction companies an opportunity to make
money and to create new jobs. But the life and health of the people are another
matter altogether. They are an unquestionable priority and something the authorities must take care of.</p><p> Ms
Skvortsova, please go ahead.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/owliZv5QiHc1YJIPZte4h9yypi6fALzc.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/m3Z4WnhD2JqseOnOAw4SXCKIs9XxneA0.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(36, 65, 254);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #2441fe 0%, rgba(36,65,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #9c98a3 0%, rgba(156,152,163,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #532040 0%, rgba(83,32,64,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #f9f0ec 0%, rgba(249,240,236,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p><b>Healthcare Minister Veronika Skvortsova</b>: Thank you very much.</p><p>Good afternoon, I would like to comment on several points.</p><p>Of course, Mr President, we are very
proactive in developing the outpatient and ambulatory care structure. Starting in 2014, we have seen an outpatient care revival both in rural areas and urban localities. </p><p>The rural infrastructure’s supply level is already now 22 percent higher.
Each year, we build between 300 and 500 rural paramedic centres. This year, at least 350 such centres will be built. The outpatient/ambulatory units are
considerably better now too. </p><p>At the same time, as you said, we
have regions – 17 of them out of 85 – that have somewhat reduced the potential
of the outpatient/ambulatory institutions. We are working with these regions
and are in direct contact with the governors and the ministers. </p><p>If we speak about ambulatory
pediatric clinics, over a period of the last four years we saw the number of district pediatricians rise by more than two thousand and the ratio of those holding
more than one job declined. Today, it amounts to just 1.1 percent, which means
that the situation is getting better. In 2016, we introduced primary certification,
and this is a great help.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>:
Ms Skvortsova, please tell us, what is happening with subsidised medicine in the regions? Could you comment? Why is subsidised medicine not always available
in the regions? </p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova</b>: As Mr President said, we have considerably increased the amount of federal budget subsidies for this category of medicine. Today’s figure is 156
billion rubles. The first instalment was sent to the regions on January 17 and the rest arrived before February 7. </p><p>Over the past few months of this
year, we have monitored the situation in all the regions. In 30 regions, we
have discovered serious organisational and logistic shortcomings. I am
referring to purchase rescheduling, wrong purchasing procedures, and, on top of this, inability to manage commodity stocks.</p><p>As a rule, these are the regions,
where there is no normal digital system of subsidised medicine provision and where healthcare organisers do not know what storage facilities or which medical
organisations have a surplus. A case in point mentioned by the President is the Saratov Region. </p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>:
Thank you. We hope that these problems will be ironed out. We have very many
other questions from a whole lot of different regions. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Just a minute…</p><p>After all, you were telling me about
a region, where recently…</p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova</b>: This was the Saratov Region.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
The Saratov Region, right. There’s a lot of medicine on the warehouse shelves,
but not in the pharmacy chain. </p><p>As for the funds, I can say that
there has been a considerable rise, especially for cancer. We have doubled the financing of cancer medicine purchases. For example, there was 80 billion
[rubles] for chemotherapy, and now 150 [billion rubles]. </p><p><b>Veronika Skvortsova</b>: Quite right!</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: Cancer has been made a separate focus area
within the Healthcare national project. </p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> We are moving to the call centre now. There are
very many calls.</p><p>Natalya
Yuryeva, take over.</p><p><b>Natalya Yuryeva:</b> Thank you, Pavel.</p><p>We are being
swamped with questions. Right now we have an incoming video call. I will ask
the operator to broadcast it now.</p><p>This year we
have very many questions about national projects, for obvious reasons. Some
people are upset that they cannot take part in them because they do not meet
the requirements, while others wonder if we need them at all. The incoming
video call has to do with this subject.</p><p>Good
afternoon. You are on the air. Please introduce yourself and ask your question.</p><p><b>Valentina Volodina:</b> Good afternoon. My name is
Valentina Volodina, and I am from Moscow.</p><p>Good
afternoon, Mr President.</p><p>I have a question about national projects. People talk a lot about them, and here is
what I would like to ask you: what results can you report so far, and what
other results can we expect in the near future? Can these projects be
accomplished, and who can do this?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Actually, this is what we began
with today, but I would like to thank you for raising this topic again. I consider it to be an extremely important and even a priority topic.</p><p>In general, we
could have decided not to focus our resources and efforts, both administrative
and financial, in specific areas, going with the stream instead and dealing with the current requirements and problems as they appeared.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/kCa6fst5ziAwG0Gvs40KdQU5lHCksJRA.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/jAZC09FKstVqB3hAZQbpcRmG3pAlAKFw.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(44, 121, 251);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #2c79fb 0%, rgba(44,121,251,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #ff4047 0%, rgba(255,64,71,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #8f929d 0%, rgba(143,146,157,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #442029 0%, rgba(68,32,41,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>But there is a different way to organise our work. I believe that we can and should pinpoint
the main sphere where we must achieve breakthrough development, as well as the main goals in terms of global trends, and we must decide what we must do and what we must strive for to improve the standard of living for our people.</p><p>I would like
to repeat that this is the key element of all our national projects, and this
is what they are intended to attain. The main thing is, as I have already said
and will probably say it several times more today, the main thing is to restructure our economy, to create a high-tech digital economy with elements of artificial intelligence, develop unmanned vehicles, develop
infrastructure.</p><p>What is our
goal? The goal is to boost labour productivity as the basis for ensuring the growth in prosperity for the people. This job has
been split up into several areas, with the required financing for each of them,
including roads (we have calculated that we need 6.5 trillion rubles until 2024
for that), healthcare, education, science and so on.</p><p>There are indicators
we must strive for in each area. Of course, we will also assess the results of our efforts. I will gauge the work of my colleagues by our progress towards
this goal.</p><p> We
will do so this year, next year and every year until 2024. Our job will not be
finished after that, of course, but we must have check points and adjust our work accordingly. In principle, I believe that everyone has been working
hard.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>When will the people feel the first
results of national projects?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>This is not the case… In the Soviet
era, they used to say that today’s generation of Soviet people will live under communism.
Nobody could understand what “today’s generation” meant. Later it was said that
the 1980 Olympic Games were held in Moscow instead of communism.</p><p>We should feel the results now, this year, next
year and so on. This must be reflected in the level of incomes and wages. We
can see that there are problems, but I am showing that there are positive
trends as well. This is the first point.</p><p>Secondly, about the issues we were discussing
just now, healthcare, and we have not spoken about science and education yet;
money must be invested and is being invested there.</p><p>And as I have said, at the first stage we
knowingly allowed some negative external factors, but this made it possible for us to concentrate our resources, allocate them where we need them, and achieve
results and breakthroughs in the end. This is the idea of the work done within
national projects.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>When you recently had a meeting with
the Cabinet on the subject of national projects, many ministers looked dejected.</p><p>This is why I would like to read out a message
from Tatyana Pinchuk: “Are the ministers personally responsible for failure to implement
the national projects they supervise?”</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>I do not think they were dejected. Let’s say they were
concentrating and thinking about how to fulfil their tasks. Speaking about
personal responsibility, yes, I have said this before – but I do not remember
if the cameras were on and if it were in the media or not – but everybody, all of my colleagues know that personal responsibility is essential, and everyone who
supervises one area or another is responsible for it.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>One more flashpoint, the so-called
trash reform: rates, landfill
sites and processing.</p><p>Tatyana Remezova, go ahead please.</p><p><b>Tatyana Remezova: </b>Thank you, colleagues. This year trash-related
issues have literally skyrocketed into the top three most frequently asked
questions. I will now ask our director to show on the big screen several photos
that were sent by viewers. Some photos came from the village of Pokrovskoye in the Rostov Region. Kseniya Bobyatinskaya writes: “What is happening with the trash reform? We are drowning in trash. Nobody takes it away from the streets
for weeks.” Yes, you have just seen these photos.</p><p>Alexander Repin from the Nizhny
Novgorod Region: “The trash reform has been going on for over five months but
people have hardly noticed any changes for the better: containers are the same,
full of holes, and trash pickup is irregular.”</p><p>Verkhnyaya Salda, Sverdlovsk Region:
“The trash reform is not working. This is what a clean city district has turned
into in six months.” It is clear from the questionaries that all these photos were sent by young
people under 35.</p><p>Blogger Katya Adushkina has just got
through to us. We will try to connect her. She is a popular instablogger and has run her blog since she was 10. She is 15 now and has over 8 million followers.

afternoon, Mr President. My name is Katya Adushkina. I am 15 and a video
blogger. I am also a fan of music and dance. Like all school kids in the world
I am very concerned that the environmental problems are getting worse. </p><p>Now containers for separating trash
have started to appear in Russia but people complain online that ultimately all
the trash goes into one heap. How will you deal with this problem and do you
have any plans to solve it?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>This is a huge problem for us. It did not emerge yesterday We have
spoken about it and returned to it many times. By the way, we started discussing
and dealing with it literally two or three years ago. Strange as it may seem,
it was all sparked by Direct Line one year. I recall people from Balashikha complained
about their predicament. After that I sent a signal to my colleagues in the regions and the Government. They began talking about it and made it a subject of discussion and attention for all levels
of government. It became clear that trash, waste products, had been piling up
for decades and nobody ever tackled this problem seriously. </p><p>I want to point out (experts know this,
but ordinary people may not) that we generate 70 million tonnes of waste each
year, 70 million. There is, in fact, no industrial recycling of this waste.
This is a huge problem, considering that landfill sites have been growing since
the Soviet era.</p><p>The situation is complicated by the fact that our society has largely become a society of consumption, despite the fact that real wages had been going down in the past years but are rising now. Nevertheless, our
society is based on consumption, generally speaking. New packaging is used now;
in addition to paper and cardboard, a lot of plastic is used for packaging,
too. There are entire islands of trash as big as an average European country in the Pacific Ocean. The lens effect is already impacting the climate of the entire planet. It is a big problem for us, and this is why we will work on this, of course.</p><p>What was shown just now is horrible.
We must see in which districts or Russian regions this is happening.</p><p>Trash pickup tariffs are growing. As you noted, yesterday, I looked through the questions for today’s Direct Line.
There are many questions about growing tariffs. Perhaps it is inevitable to some extent, because at least some starter money is necessary to carry out system-wide
work. Of course, people should see results, and this is not a case where we must
wait for 20 years. These are the results people should feel right now.</p><p>Recently we made a decision; I have
agreed to let governors choose who will work at these container yards: managing
companies in charge of a corresponding residential building or neighbourhood,
or so-called regional operators. Some people believe that regional operators
will not be able to reach these yards, and others think it would be better to place all the responsibility in one set of hands.</p><p> To tell the truth, it makes no difference to me,
but many governors believe that it would be better to use regional operators. They
are free to. Of course, we must examine these pictures and find out where they
came from. There are many things like this. I hope that we will manage to do
this and clean up there soon. And of course, I will keep an eye on this, even
if trash is not exactly the most glamorous topic.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: Tatyana, another call please.</p><p><b>Tatyana Remezova</b>: Mr President, you mentioned tariffs,
so let us talk about it in more detail, because we have a lot of questions on this particular topic.</p><p>Retired people especially have been completely
bewildered by the bills they began receiving after January 1. Let us now listen
to a video message from Roman Dmitriyev from Omsk.</p><p><b>Roman Dmitriyev</b>: Trash reform has begun, but there has
been no progress in areas with single-family homes like the ​​Old Kirovsk
neighbourhood we live in.</p><p>These are my bills, I am holding them in my hand. For March – that is, before the trash reform – we paid 90.27 rubles per
month. It went like this: once a month, on the 20<sup>th</sup>, they brought a large
container to my street, for all the people who live on this street to dump the trash they have been accumulating in their courtyards.</p><p>After the start of the trash reform, the process
did not change in any way, but the bill did change: in April, they charged us
133 rubles, and the one we got the day before yesterday was 266 rubles! Why is this
reform proceeding on paper, when there is no real progress?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: I cannot but agree with Roman that
this not only raises questions and eyebrows, but also inspires protest. And, of course, it goes without saying that it should not be like this.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some things we need
to note. For example, in the past, no one had ever thought of how much trash removal
costs. This is the first point.</p><p>Secondly, today nobody wants to have any
landfills near where they live, which means trash has to be transported far
away, and this also means money, the cost of transport, the fuel that must be used,
drivers’ pay, and so on and so forth.</p><p>This is to say that trash removal may indeed be
more expensive now, but what Roman said, of course, requires additional verification
and careful analysis.</p><p>And again, the most important thing is to find
the responsible party: it’s either the managing company or the regional
operator. This certainly needs to be done. In this case, we need to check. I will definitely ask the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service to deal with this.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: People do not want to have a landfill site near their place. We have had a lot of messages from the regions,
and we are left with a vicious circle: on the one hand, people do not want landfills
near where they live; on the other hand, we cannot do without landfills, not when
the problem has been snowballing for decades. Is there any long-term waste
recycling programme in our country? Will there be one?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: We have a programme planned for the next few years,
which envisages the construction of 200 waste processing plants. The total
amount of funding is slightly above 300 billion rubles, with about one third of the amount coming from the federal budget, and the remaining funds need to be
raised from businesses. The government part has been budgeted, and we will duly
provide the financing.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Mr President, important decisions to support
large families have been adopted this year. I am a mother of four children, so
I follow closely…</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/WIKSFze0MirqJukdfPQJyZxAchsQes8Z.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/dXZw3EgXIox5q4dgbQ3FNwBbuDk9oAMN.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(244, 228, 230);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #f4e4e6 0%, rgba(244,228,230,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #2e2327 0%, rgba(46,35,39,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #c18468 0%, rgba(193,132,104,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #5e63c6 0%, rgba(94,99,198,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Here: “Can child benefit payments be extended
up to three years?” </p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Yes, this must be done, and tangible support
has been approved.</p><p>But we also have proposals coming from large
families: For instance: “Can the programme of state support of mortgage lending
for large families with a 6 percent interest rate be extended to include the secondary housing market? Because currently the programme
covers only the primary
housing market.”</p><p>Or another one: ‘Can 450,000 rubles allocated
to families that are classified as large as of January 1, 2019, be used as a down payment to buy housing, because it is impossible to take out a mortgage
without a down payment, and saving the amount is simply too difficult?’</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Shall be start with the question about six
percent?</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Yes.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Six percent interest rate for a mortgage.
Well, what is happening here and what happened? Indeed, there was such a decision, my instruction for families with children, moreover for families
where the second and third child is born: a mortgage on beneficial terms with a six percent interest rate must be ensured. Can it be even lower? It can and this is already being done in the Far East, where the rate is five percent.</p><p>What happened with these 6 percent? I saw a lot
of messages on the topic in the stack of questions that I looked through
yesterday, the day before yesterday and three days ago,. It is difficult for people to resolve this, or the problem is not solved with banks regarding the 6
percent: it does not apply to the loans issued previously.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: They do not recalculate the loans; they do
not want to do it.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: They do not recalculate. This is a real mistake of the Russian
Government and the relevant agencies. What is the mistake? The Finance Ministry
did not allocate sufficient funds to compensate banks for this subsidy
objectives. They initially decided that 2 percent will be enough. It is not.</p><p>So this problem needs to be addressed through
two channels: through the Finance Ministry, which should work with large banks,
such as Sberbank and VTB, and through the DOM.RF state company (they work with
small and medium-sized banks).</p><p>The reason it was not resolved through either
channel is that the Government did not allocate the necessary resources. But
even before Direct Line, after I looked through the questions, I spoke with Government
members, including the Finance Ministry leadership, and in principle, this
problem has already been solved. The Finance Ministry has allocated the necessary resources, and I hope that in the near future there will be progress and we will see tangible results.</p><p>As for the 450,000-ruble benefit for the repayment
of a family’s mortgage loan upon birth of their third child. What can be said
here, we provided it specifically for this purpose, and this alone, because this
sphere of life, especially for families with children, is the most important,
the most sensitive one.</p><p>By the way, the maternity capital, as we look
at the statistics of its use, is mainly being spent to improve housing
conditions. We launched the programme precisely for this purpose, and we will
do it retroactively from January 1, 2019, and that is why it is not provided
for other purposes.</p><p>By the way, back to the 6 percent mortgage
issue, this programme of state support for families with two, three or more
children is valid from January 1, 2018 until December 31, 2022.</p><p>And I want everyone who is using this programme to know that, if they take out a loan before
December 30, their discount on mortgage interest will be valid for the entire term
of the loan.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Mr President, I would like to add
that many people are writing to us that they should have waited instead of having
a child in 2017. I mean, had they known that this programme would be launched,
they would have postponed the birth of their second or third children. Indeed,
there are such messages.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: This should not be postponed.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/APOsvG1zLY1JF1dnVj0jKftO6RMy1LbA.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/GkN5U6MwnI7B3iWhz4C6meDyBxZgQYia.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(37, 113, 240);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #2571f0 0%, rgba(37,113,240,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #66575a 0%, rgba(102,87,90,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #aabcc6 0%, rgba(170,188,198,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #10142a 0%, rgba(16,20,42,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Well, yes.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin</b>: This is something that is not measured with
money.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>Let us turn things over to our call centre again.</p><p><b>Tatyana Remezova: </b>Thank you very much.</p><p>Right now I have a call on this
topic. We are receiving many calls from young mothers regarding maternity
leave. It is true that the financial assistance they receive during this
period, from eighteen months to three years when mothers cannot work, is called
many things, Mr President: a joke or a humiliating sum, for example. Now we
have Yekaterina Kirillova from Serpukhov. You can see she is sitting right next
to her child’s bed, who unfortunately has fallen asleep while waiting. But the President can hear you, Katya. Ask your question, please.</p><p><b>Yekaterina Kirillova: </b>Good afternoon, Mr President.</p><p>My name is Yekaterina. I live in the Moscow Region and I am on maternity leave. My son is ten months today.</p><p>I have been regularly receiving
child care benefit paid until the child turns 18 months old. But when my son
turns eighteen months, I will receive 50 rubles per month, so I have a question: are there any plans to change this sum, because mothers I know can only
see this sum as a joke and cannot understand what purpose it serves. I think
that perhaps it would be better to end it altogether and not spend the money
from the budget.</p><p>Those who decide to go to work and leave their children in daycare nurseries face a different problem. Queues for nurseries are very long, and it is very difficult to get into one. Most
children who get into them have some kind of preference. This is my question.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Interesting. We have just seen this on the screen: a question about
increasing support for families with children under three. Was that not your
question?</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>We have received a text message with almost the same question.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>On the screen right now.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>Our caller is not responding.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Not responding, ok. I would like to say this.</p><p> First, it is true that a new measure of support has
recently been introduced: we began to pay money to families with a first and second child. We have maternity capital for the second child, but there has
never been a similar measure for the first one. On the whole, it is quite
large, equal to the minimum subsistence level for a child in the region. On average – let me repeat that this is the average sum. It differs from region to region, but it is about 10,500 today, almost 11,000 rubles on average.</p><p>This financial assistance is
provided to families for their first and subsequent child. The money for the first
child is allocated directly from the budget; the money for the second can be allocated,
at the family’s request, from maternity capital. And the financial support is
provided to the family according to its needs, as they say. I am talking about
families where one adult worker’s average income equals 1.5 times the region’s subsistence
minimum. Our country’s subsistence minimum equals the minimum wage; it is
estimated at an average of 11,280 rubles. 1.5 times the subsistence wage per
person, how much is that? 17,000 rubles. Roughly speaking, 17,000 plus 17,000
equals about 34,000. This means, if the family’s income is 34,000 for two adults,
today, this family is entitled to financial assistance equalling 10,000 rubles – I repeat, this is an average number for the whole country. This is the minimum subsistence level for a child. </p><p>We have almost adopted the decision at this point; we have talked about this with the Government, with the Prime
Minister. The latter has recently delivered the Government’s report to Parliament
in the State Duma, and said that we would increase the number of families
provided with this assistance, with this benefit.</p><p>How? Starting January 1, 2020, we
will extend this assistance to not only families with 1.5 times the subsistence
minimum per person, but also families with two subsistence minimums per person.
Essentially, this means, relatively speaking, two minimum wages: 11,280 plus
11,280 equals 22,000, 23,000 rubles. In total for two, about 45,000 rubles. If
the family earns about 45,000 rubles, it is entitled to compensation equal to the subsistence minimum for a child in the region. This is on average 10,000 to 11,000 rubles. Not so bad really, I think.</p><p> Now to address the issue of the 50 rubles that I read about on the screen and that this woman just talked about while describing
her situation. Indeed, this first measure covers children under eighteen months,
while the second category, from eighteen months to three years, was left out.
Not left out, but was granted 50 rubles worth of compensation. And the question
was: maybe we should spare the budget such expenses? The thing is, this is not
budget money we are talking about. In 1994, a decision was taken; a Presidential
Executive Order was signed. The situation was extremely difficult, and employers were made to pay these 50 rubles. This money did not make much of a difference back then, and now, of course, it is means nothing – I mean, what
are 50 rubles, really?</p><p>So we have been searching for a solution of late. I actually think it has been found already, in fact the decision is
ready. We will make the payments, in accordance with the family’s needs,
depending on their income, to families with children aged from eighteem months to three years, in the amount of the subsistence minimum for a child. The only
thing we still need to decide is the level of income that makes a family
eligible. Either one and a half of the subsistence minimum per person, or two.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/93ubAQIA83ZiO6ka3C0ZWssPMpKFxqlC.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/zcjJlZk13lQbkP1UcpVAXgbnCY0jT8Go.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(30, 49, 84);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #1e3154 0%, rgba(30,49,84,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #4257d5 0%, rgba(66,87,213,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #6a6874 0%, rgba(106,104,116,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #bdb2b1 0%, rgba(189,178,177,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>What was the mum's name?</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Yekaterina.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: We can work it out with Yekaterina
right now…</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Calculate.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: No, not calculate, but make a decision. There is nothing to calculate, everything is clear.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Can we reach Yekaterina again?</p><p>Unfortunately, they tell me there is no
connection yet. They are dialling again.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: It does not matter. It is
important to agree on a benchmark amount to rely on in the future to give this support
to families with children.</p><p>Look, if from January 1, 2020, we start
supporting families that earn two subsistence-minimum incomes and have children
under eighteen months, it means the programme will reach 70 percent of families. It will be noticeable.</p><p>On the other hand, it will be strange to bring
the eligibility cutoff down to 1.5 subsistence minimum per person, once the child reaches the age of eighteen months – this would immediately reduce the number of families eligible for this support programme. So I believe – and I have actually decided this for myself
a long time ago – we will have to extend it to all families with an income of two
subsistence minimums.</p><p>If you go back to the beginning of our
discussion, to the beginning of our conversation, a colleague from the Emergencies Ministry said how much he makes, even an officer in his position makes
about 43,000, so such a family will immediately become eligible (mum goes on maternity
leave and will not work).</p><p>Finally, I think that in the near future we
will simply finalise this decision. We have one more support programme; it
extends to regions with negative demographics, but there are already 65 such
regions. There, families also receive a benefit in the amount of a child’s
subsistence minimum for their third child.</p><p>We will continue this programme, but I would
ask the Government to look at the regions of Siberia and the Urals. This is
something to think about. They are not yet included in these 65 regions, but we
still need to look at what is actually happening with demographics there.</p><p> In principle, yes, this is a new solution.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Let’s go back
to economic issues. Many people link these difficulties with the Western
sanctions. By the way, the European Union again extended them today. Sometimes,
there are appeals to make peace with everyone. If Russia complied with the West’s
demands and agreed to everything, would this benefit our economy in any way?</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>First, what does it mean “to make peace”? We have not fought with anyone
and have no desire to fight with anyone. </p><p>Second, what would
this give us and what would it not give us, and what would we lose? Look, according
to expert analyses, Russia fell short by about $50 billion as a result of these
restrictions during these years, starting in 2014. The European Union lost $240
billion, the US $17 billion (we have a small volume of trade with them) and Japan $27 billion. All this affects employment in these countries, including
the EU: they are losing our market. </p><p>I quoted our
losses. They are tentative. Nevertheless, let’s assume we have accepted this.
But we also received something. What exactly? First, we had to change our thinking
(and we did this) to understand what we needed to do in the high-tech economic
sectors and how. </p><p>Our so-called
import substitution programmes are worth 667 billion rubles. This compelled us
to develop even those areas where we lacked competence before. </p><p>I talked about this
and can repeat it now. Say, the RSFSR
(the Soviet Union) and new Russia never had domestic marine engine manufacturing.
We bought these engines abroad.</p><p>It turned out that
it was not enough to manufacture engines, generally speaking. Marine engines
are a special story, a separate technology, a separate branch, and a separate
competence. </p><p> We learned that in just a few years. We made our
own engines that were not only not inferior but even superior to their Western
counterparts in some respects. We also made progress in many other areas –
for instance, transport engineering, power
engineering, not to mention agriculture.</p><p>Look, if ten years ago I or anyone else in this
hall had been told that we would be exporting agricultural products worth $25.7
billion, like we did last year, I would have laughed in the face of the person
who said this. We would shake hands and I would thank them for their kind but
unrealistic intentions.</p><p>Today this is a fact. Moreover, we want to reach
$45 billion in agricultural exports by 2024, and I believe we can do this. Of course, it is still a question whether we will achieve this or not, but we must
work on it; this is a realistic plan. So we were mobilised in many areas.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/1XiL1AQXcuFyPBo307eOvXE1EMCtc1Wv.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/6iDKdRZkwP3InTdIMoAqKrw0bsFSSuJW.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(177, 146, 133);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #b19285 0%, rgba(177,146,133,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #38424c 0%, rgba(56,66,76,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #b6f1ff 0%, rgba(182,241,255,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #576171 0%, rgba(87,97,113,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>Now to the question of whether some things
would be different if we give in and abandon our fundamental national
interests. We are not talking about reconciliation here. Perhaps there will be
some external signals, but no drastic change. Look, the People’s Republic of China has nothing to do with Crimea and Donbass, does it? We are accused of occupying Donbass, which is nonsense and a lie. But China has nothing to do
with it, and yet the tariffs for Chinese goods are rising, which is almost the same as sanctions.</p><p>Now, the attack on Huawei: where does it come
from and what is its objective? The objective is to hold back the development
of China, the country that has become a global rival of another power, the United States. The same is happening with Russia, and will continue to happen,
so if we want to occupy a worthy place under the sun, we must become stronger,
including, and above all, in the economy.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>But voices in Europe are growing
stronger saying it is time to stop…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Excuse me, but this is because
nobody really likes this. We have lost 50 billion, and Europe has lost 240
billion. This affects many economic sectors in Europe, in European countries, so
what’s good about it?</p><p>In fact, even though we have gained something
from these external restrictions, personally I believe that it is better to live in normal economic conditions, going by some general rules that everyone
abides by.</p><p><b>Tatyana
Remezova: </b>Nevertheless, today the EU will address the issue
whether to extend sanctions against Russia without examining it, which means the issue
was automatically submitted for approval.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>
Let us get back to our call centre. </p><p><b>Natalya Yuryeva:</b> Thank you, Yelena.</p><p>Our Centre has already received over
1,800,000 questions, and they continue coming in at an incredible speed. Let us
see where people are calling from. Where is this question from?</p><p><b>Call centre operator:</b> The city of Kursk.</p><p><b>Natalya Yuryeva: </b>And this one?</p><p><b>Call centre operator:</b> The city of Tomsk.</p><p><b>Natalya Yuryeva: </b>And what about this one?</p><p><b>Call centre operator:</b> The village of Kaskara, Tyumen Region.</p><p><b>Natalya Yuryeva: </b>They are writing there is no running
water. The lack of running water seems unthinkable in the 21<sup>st</sup>
century. Let us listen to this particular call: “Good afternoon, Mr President,
my name is Maria, from the village of Kaskara, Tyumen District, Tyumen Region. Construction
work in our village has been continuing for more than 20 years, but we still
have no water. There are over 300 residents, many kids, and we have to go for water to neighbouring villages. But initially, there was a water spout in the neighbouring
village, which was then dismantled. And now we buy bottled water in Tyumen. At the same time, there is a water supply system for the Tyumen Broiler poultry
farm near us. We asked the mayor to divert some, but the promise has not been kept.
Mr President, you are our only hope, please help us solve this issue with
water. Thank you.”</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Excuse me, look, I have an idea.
Let us contact Tyumen right now and find a film crew there and send them to the village to see what is happening there. And we will return to this issue, we
will contact them in the course of the programme. Do you agree?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Wait, what region is this?</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Tyumen Region.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>All right.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> So, we are sending a crew now and contacting Tyumen. We are sending a correspondent to this village. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> However, I must say a few words.
Tyumen Region and Tyumen is a self-sufficient region, it is a fairly wealthy region
in the Federation. Very strange. Is this some extremely remote village or what?</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> We will find out everything during
the programme.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> Fine.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>Yes, because it is very strange that there is no water there at all.</p><p>Over the 12 days when we received
messages, interesting things began to happen in the regions. Decisions were
made even before the Direct Line started; the authorities began to stir and officials found time to meet and talk with people. The Investigative Committee
started noticing some details.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/CewacVtetXHnWfUg3cZKx1sNRCwAZfNA.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/FfhLLQSaABqk4DMRGHmiLU5qXKhmoEuw.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(163, 176, 186);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #a3b0ba 0%, rgba(163,176,186,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #3c322c 0%, rgba(60,50,44,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #0590ff 0%, rgba(5,144,255,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #e50022 0%, rgba(229,0,34,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>Thus, for example, the director of an oil refinery already has been arrested in Belgorod Region; workers there had
received no wages for a year. In Kaluga Region, there is a family living in a ramshackle home that, I believe, dates back to the post-war period. The house
was found untenable in 2014. The Investigative Committee has intervened. There
are many places like this in Russia.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>Including the so-called “whale prison” in Primorye Territory. For six months,
it has been a top story in Russia. Therefore, we sent our film crew there. As soon as Olga Armyakova arrived there, as soon as they learnt that it may be a topic
for Direct Line, amazing things began to happen there.</p><p>Primorye Territory, Olga Armyakova.</p><p><b>Olga Armyakova: </b>Good afternoon, Moscow, or more precisely, good evening. It is almost
8.30 pm in the Far East, already dusk, but do not let the darkness bother you.
Our crew is on the coast of the Sea of Japan, Srednyaya Bay. It is unbelievably
beautiful here.</p><p>However, we came here for another
reason. You can see the marine mammal adaptation centre, the one called the “whale prison,” which the whole world is watching right now. Almost 100 belugas
and killer whales have been living here for about a year. In these cages, you
can see baby whales: they are very curious – they are trying to get a look at our
crew – and playful: they tried to splash us with water several times, creatures
of fantastic beauty. They are beluga whales, by the way. They were caught in the Okhotsk Sea “for scientific and educational purposes.” This is the official
wording.</p><p>However, later it was reported that
they want to sell the animals abroad. Surprisingly the business people had all
the authorisations they needed, but the law had changed, and the export of whales was prohibited. It was the beginning of a difficult legal puzzle, and these amazing rare animals, belugas and killer whales, fell victim to it.</p><p> Let me remind you that the President ordered their future
to be decided by March 1. Since then, expert commissions have come here as well
as scientists from the Cousteau team; the entire country united in order to save the beluga and killer whales. However, there had been no breakthrough
until today. It is an interesting coincidence or, in other words, the miraculous effect of Direct Line; there is no other way to put it. It is more
important that right now two killer whales and six belugas are being moved to the area of the Shantar Islands to be released there; and this is, of course,
an international sensation.</p><p>Our camera crew were the only
journalists who could see the animals being prepared for resettlement. I suggest we watch a report.</p><p><i>(Video report demonstration)</i></p><p>This is just the beginning of a large-scale
project, which, by the way, still continues. Even though it is raining here.
Scientists will be able to assess the success of this special operation later.
The main thing now is to get it done. Let me remind you that nothing like this
has ever happened in the world.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> This is a well-known problem, and it is generally clear why these issues
arise. The killer whales alone, as far as I know, cost about $100 million, so
there are many “interested” parties, so to say, and this is why solving the problem is not easy. There are always issues when a lot of money is involved.</p><p>But thank God, some movement has begun.
We have Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeyev on the line. Go ahead, please, Mr
Gordeyev.</p><p><b>Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeyev: </b>Good afternoon, Mr President, good afternoon,
Direct Line participants. </p><p>In essence, the correspondent has
reported everything correctly. I would only add that a special group set up by the Government has been commissioned, and we took control of this issue because
we understand the public relevance of this problem.</p><p>The group is made up of specialists,
scientists, representatives from both federal and regional bodies, Primorye
Territory is also involved; we are grateful to the many specialists from there.
Under the scientists’ recommendation, the only correct decision was taken, to transport the animals to their habitat, where they were caught, to their
natural environment. The operation will take about four months.</p><p>We have instructed the Russian Research
Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography to monitor and conduct this operation.
So it will be done by specialists. Afterwards, when the animals are placed in Shantarstakaya Bay in Khabarovsk Territory, the specialists will continue
monitoring them. The priority is appropriate re-adaptation, as was said earlier.</p><p>Mr President, we are working around
the clock, we will conduct daily monitoring. The operation is indeed unusual
but very interesting, and it is also a fairly interesting scientific experiment
at the same time.</p><p>To prevent similar events in the future, so the mammals are not caught in such numbers, the Government decided
to change the law, to prohibit catching them for so-called cultural and educational
purposes and allow a small number of animals to be caught only for research
purposes and for the people of the Far North, which is their tradition. This
decision will be brought to the Government level so the public can take part in it.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>Thank you, Mr Gordeyev, we understand you.</p><p>Mr President, we should have held Direct
Line earlier, then the killer whales could have been released sooner, although
it could be just a coincidence.</p><p>Mr President, we have a lot of guests here today…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Excuse me, please. I would like to respond to some things that I just saw
on the screen. These are questions of a political nature, so I do not want
anyone to get the impression that we are dodging these questions. This one is
quite sharp: “Where is this gang of patriots from United Russia leading us?”</p><p>I believe that when people take
responsibility, including for making decisions that are not very popular, but badly
needed by the country, it means that these are mature people who consciously
chose strengthening their country and improving people's lives as the goal of their
lives, and of their political careers.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/W819dAzrleaBgm6DmNfVLDgUKoStL8L0.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/t5PfLPg5sn8LAFaJ88RFc1dVk3fqGZuJ.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(30, 52, 254);background:linear-gradient(180deg, #1e34fe 0%, rgba(30,52,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #d2a48d 0%, rgba(210,164,141,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #a386a0 0%, rgba(163,134,160,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #342020 0%, rgba(52,32,32,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>I would not call the people who were
at the helm in the 1990s a “gang.” But I must note that during that time our
social sphere, industry and the defence sector collapsed. We lost the defence
industry, we practically destroyed the Armed Forces, led the country into a civil
war, to bloodshed in the Caucasus, and brought the country to the verge of losing
sovereignty and collapse – I have to put this bluntly.</p><p>I would not say that all people who
worked in the 1990s are responsible for this, but surely, if this happened,
there must have been those who should be held responsible for it. I repeat, I do not want to call them a “gang,” but such is the result of their work. This
is about the first question I saw.</p><p>The second one: “When will the local
authorities be elected again?” If you are talking about local authorities, if you
mean municipalities, they are always elected. We do have an election procedure through
regional parliaments (this is stipulated by law). This, by the way, is also an election, but, as a rule, leaders of municipalities are elected by a direct
secret vote of the entire population.</p><p>Finally, one last question: “What kind
of secrets do the Interior Ministry employees know, that they are not allowed
to travel abroad?” Just a few days ago, I spoke with Minister of the Interior
Vladimir Kolokoltsev, who also asked this question.</p><p>Indeed, Interior Ministry officials –
maybe not all of them, only some – do know these secrets, but not all; ordinary
employees do not. Therefore, we agreed that we would expand the geography of possible foreign travel for Interior Ministry officials.</p><p>But in general, still, Interior
Ministry employees are endowed with special powers, and in this sense, of course, they are in a special position. They have to make an informed choice whether
they want to work with these restrictions or not.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Absolutely.</p><p>Mr President, let us talk to the guests here in our studio, they have quite a few questions. We promised to give
them the floor. Olga Pautova, please.</p><p><b>Olga Pautova:</b>
Mr President, I suggest we change the topic and move on from cities to villages, because today we have a lot of farmers in our studio. Maria
Kandyrina, for instance, has a small dairy farm; her cheeses have recently been
awarded a gold medal at an international exhibition in France.</p><p>Next to her is Boris Akimov. Back in the day, he came up with the idea of the LavkaLavka shop, where he would sell
other farmers’ products; today, he is a farmer himself. He told us he was now
growing his own variety of garlic and even producing Pereslavl parmesan cheese
and jamon. Did you bring us some to try?</p><p><b>Boris Akimov:</b>
No, everything is back in the village of Knyazhevo.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
Looks like we have to go there. They say their products are in great demand.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Jamon is a Spanish product, parmesan is Italian. They are produced
differently, using different techniques.</p><p><b>Boris Akimov:</b>
And now we have our own.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
Is your jamon good?</p><p><b>Boris Akimov:</b>
So they say.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
What do you think?</p><p><b>Boris Akimov:</b>
I am not one to brag. But seems like it.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
Then tell us about your problems and ask the President your question.</p><p><b>Boris Akimov:</b>
Today, the government provides way more assistance to agribusiness holding
companies than to farmers, about 90 percent of all assistance is provided to the 10 largest Russian companies.</p><p>Meanwhile, these companies’ profits do
not stay local, but are rather in Moscow, or, even more often, abroad, in offshore accounts. While small farmers, small businesses invest in the areas
where they live and work, thus becoming a driver of local development.</p><p>I believe we have a concrete
suggestion on how these priorities could be adjusted somewhat. Europe has a great example of promoting regional products. Take, for instance, again,
parmesan, or Parma ham, or champagne. They serve as drivers for these areas,
providing a great number of farmers and small businesses with jobs.</p><p>Our idea is to launch a similar
programme for making regional products in Russia. I am sure this would give
many farmers and small businesses a boost, while the local area would start
developing as well; good for farmers, good for consumers, too.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>

Akimov:</b> Basically, this is the suggestion: we have many
regional brands that are often forgotten. Take the Breitovo garlic that I grow,
for instance, or Pavlovo chickens, or Murom cucumbers.</p><p>In other words, there are many products
that can be revived and become the drivers of the development of this
territory. It would be great to extend this programme to the entire country. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Once again,
please, what programme? Can you please explain?</p><p><b>Boris Akimov:</b> A programme to develop
products of local, territorial origin. There is a place called Pavlovo in Nizhny Novgorod Region. At one time, it was famous for its Pavlovo chicken
breed. These chickens were famous.</p><p>Today, every region has many interesting
products that could be revived, that could become economic drivers in their territories.
They would create jobs and farmers would be employed.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>So, you are talking about the development of local brands, so to speak.</p><p><b>Boris Akimov:</b> Yes, the development of product brands.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I see. We basically have, say,
Vologda butter that is well-known at least in the country and maybe even
abroad. So, generally, this has not been lost.</p><p>I fully agree with you that the state and the media should help with this, although the media will want us to pay and then they will promote whatever we want. But, of course, the state should
provide support.</p><p>At the same time, I think what you said
about farmers and large farms are repercussions of the debates on what the state
should primarily focus on. And I agree with you. I know about these debates and I know who pushed for this. I am just kidding. </p><p>Jokes aside, this is the former governor
of Krasnodar Territory, Alexander Tkachyov. He kept saying that large commodity
production was a driver of agriculture and indeed, it provides the main
commodities and this is true both for this country and abroad. But we should
certainly not forget about small and medium farms, and I fully agree with you
on this.</p><p> However, I think that you still have incomplete
information in this respect. What do I mean? Look, first, the amount of commodity
production at farms recently increased by 45 percent. Overall, this is decent
growth, and it would have been impossible without state support.</p><p>Government support for agriculture totaled
254 billion rubles last year; this year, it is more than 300–303 billion. This
includes export support. Of the total amount, around 45 percent goes to large companies,
while smaller farms account for 16 percent. Smaller farmers, who are rolling
out more and more products, today account for 12 percent of the market.</p><p>What does this mean? This means that
the amount of support they are given is greater than their market. And this implies
that the government is pushing them towards further development. If, as I believe, this happens, in the very near future, their share of the market will
equal the level of support they get, growing from 12 percent to 16.</p><p>Here of course, I fully agree with
you, the state will have to lend a hand and take the next step, especially
since there are areas of activity where smaller farms are indispensable.
Farmers, in general, are an absolutely organic part of the agriculture industry.</p><p>As for brand support, you are again
correct; we need to think about this. I will ask Dmitry Patrushev [Minister of Agriculture] to draft proposals.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>

Leave your address with us after the programme.</p><p>A lot of housing has been built in Russia in recent years. The shortage of housing is less important now and the issue has been pushed to the background by another problem – now there is a lack of infrastructure in new residential areas: there are no kindergartens,
schools, clinics, or public gardens.</p><p>I will just read a couple of messages. Moscow Region: “Why, when building new complexes, residents' needs for schools, kindergartens, or other infrastructure are not taken into account? If
you need children, you have to think about their living conditions.”</p><p>Another one: “The infrastructure was
never built. There is no kindergarten, no schools, and the developer is on the wanted
list.”</p><p>Mr President, let us go to our call
centre, there are many calls on this subject, I know.</p><p><b>Natalya Yuryeva:</b> Colleagues, for starters, I will say that our call centre has just
undergone a massive DDoS attack from abroad. Apparently, this is the reason for the disruptions in video calls we encountered.</p><p> But we have managed to repel it; the app was restarted
and we are continuing to receive calls. The total number is already approaching
2 million.</p><p>We really do have a lot of questions about infrastructure. In Vologda there
is a dire shortage of kindergartens, especially in the Leningradsky, Okruzhnoi
and Gagarinsky districts.</p><p>Rostov-on-Don: a problem with the new Suvorovsky neighbourhood, where
plans provided for gardens. They are now being replaced with high-rise buildings.
</p><p>Voronezh, the Protsessor neighbourhood. There are many young families
who were promised a school back in 2017, but construction has been put off
until 2028. Which school will their children go to for the next 10 years? Who
knows.</p><p>We also have a video call from Kseniya Bessonova in Krasnoyarsk.</p><p>Kseniya, you are on air.</p><p><b>Ksenia Bessonova:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Good afternoon.</p><p><b>Ksenia Bessonova:</b> I call on you on behalf of all the residents
of the 3rd neighbourhood, who need your assistance for a school, a kindergarten
and a park to be added to the neighbourhood. Over 70,000 people live here, in Solnechny, mostly new builds, and mostly young families with small children.</p><p>The schools that we do have are crowded with three times more pupils
than acceptable. The birth rate in our neighbourhood was the highest in Krasnoyarsk, but the social infrastructure is a real problem. The shortage of places in our schools and kindergartens is estimated at over 3,000.</p><p>In 2018 we protected the area where a school and a kindergarten were to be built when we learned that residential buildings would be built there
instead. The residents held protests, and the residential construction decision
was called off.</p><p>But several months ago we learned that the city authorities had issued
residential building permits for the remaining part of the municipally owned
land in the third neighbourhood where a park was to be created. The problem is
that there are no parks or public gardens in the new residential
neighbourhoods, that is, in the larger part of Solnechny. Our children have
nowhere to go outdoors. Please, help us.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I see that Krasnoyarsk Territory
Governor [Alexander] Uss is taking part in this meeting via videoconference.
Let him answer your question. I believe that in this particular case he should
say how your problem will be settled. This must be done by all means no matter
how complicated it may be.</p><p>I would like to say the following in this connection. This problem has
not appeared because of changes in the housing legislation. And it should have
been settled a long time ago.</p><p>The example you have provided suggests the opposite, but such problems
were usually settled in the following manner: when the construction was
co-financed by the future residents, the joint development contracts stipulated
the construction of the social infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals and kindergartens.</p><p> This does not seem to be your case, though. It is clearly
the fault of those who made the construction decision at the local and regional
levels. Even the regional authorities are not to blame here, for such decisions
are made by the local authorities.</p><p>But, unfortunately, this problem will now become more acute. I am
talking about this in order to once again draw the attention of the Russian
Government and the regional colleagues to this matter. Why?</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/4kxgVC9L7O1sCEtCi9vlh6tK622QsRhK.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/c6xAD3ACxeulNdKyAKf5CmBGuwg1rrzI.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(35, 66, 254);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #2342fe 0%, rgba(35,66,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #e1a18a 0%, rgba(225,161,138,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #6b503b 0%, rgba(107,80,59,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #0a0e14 0%, rgba(10,14,20,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>Because we are converting to new forms of housing construction linked
with the decision to alleviate the burden on the people, the risks, rather, so
as not to create new problems with unfinished construction projects. Now we are
shifting this burden and the risks onto financial organisations, with state
support.</p><p>I repeat, in the first case, equity construction investors paid for this, one way or another. In the long run, it was included in the overall
housing costs. Today, the state, namely, the federal Government or the specific
region and municipalities with regional support, are supposed to build the social infrastructure under the law.</p><p>This is what the law says, but they still have no source. The Government
and Russian regions now have to create a legal system that would make it
possible to build the social infrastructure along with housing, and that would
also determine the sources of financing for such construction. Now, let us
listen to the governor in this particular case.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>Mr Uss, could you make it very
brief? Will you solve the problem?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, Mr Uss, go ahead. </p><p><b>Krasnoyarsk Territory
Governor Alexander Uss:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President. </p><p>Indeed, the Solnechny residential area is far from ideal, and high-density construction is a typical legacy of the 1990s. It is located on the city’s outskirts and, to be frank, it has never been a high-priority area.
At the same time, I would like to note that a school and a kindergarten opened
there earlier in 2019, and I attended the kindergarten opening.</p><p>I was surprised to learn that land plots suitable for construction,
including these social projects, were allotted to municipalities for commercial
housing construction projects. If so, we will modify this decision. At the same
time, I would like to note that the residential area is located on the city’s
outskirts, so we will probably find an opportunity to set up a park there.</p><p>I would also like to say that this particular residential area is
included in our Housing priority project. In this sense, modern urban
development approaches can be implemented there, although it is impossible to completely eliminate the legacy that we have received.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Thank you. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I am sorry, but I would like to address the governor once again. Please go there and talk to the people. Please
see what can be done to expand the social infrastructure in line with this
woman’s request. If you need any assistance, we are ready to provide such
individual targeted assistance. I am confident that Krasnoyarsk Territory can
accomplish this task. In any event, please report on this to me separately as soon as possible.</p><p><b>Alexander
Uss:</b> All right, thank you.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>We had problems with calls at the beginning, so let us give the call centre another chance.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Let me also respond to some text
messages here, or whatever it is on the screen: “When will officials have wages
like average workers?” You know, I have seen a lot of such questions. Let us
imagine that a minister will receive the wages of an average worker. It pains
me to say this, and I would very much like to… Do you remember this famous
joke: “We should work not so that there are no more rich people, but so that
there are no poor people?” I would like the wages of an average worker to grow.</p><p>What can be the problem if we simply decrease the wages of officials,
ministers or even top managers at large state companies? We will not find
enough qualified experts. They will go to private offices or move abroad, and in the end this will affect the prosperity of Russia and these average workers
we are talking about, because there will be no effective decisions, no
development plans, and no one to implement them. It is obvious that people
should get wages according to their qualifications, according to their professional
and personal qualities and, of course, according to the results of their work.</p><p>However, I agree with you that the difference must not be colossal. If
we turn to top managers at our large state companies, we will see some peculiarities
here as well. To tell the truth, I am also rankled sometimes to see their
incomes. By the way, I have said this many times. But the thing is, their
companies – and this is really necessary – have many foreign experts, and the level of their salaries is comparable to what the top executives get. You see, if
we decrease their pay sharply, they will have a deficit of experts, like in healthcare, and the consequences can be dire.</p><p>Nevertheless, let me repeat that the difference must not be colossal. I agree with you. We should think about this.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>Tatyana, a call, please.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I am sorry.</p><p> Incidentally, in healthcare or education, senior professionals
receive ten times more, and I am not even speaking about ministers, ten times
more than an average employee at a hospital or an educational institution. Of course, this is unacceptable, and we must definitely focus on this.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> We have a call. Tatyana?</p><p><b>Tatyana Remezova:</b> Thank you, colleagues.</p><p>We are receiving very many questions and calls from outside Russia. Let
us take a quick glance at them. This map shows those who are trying to connect
with us via OK Live. We have calls from London, Paris, Zurich, Hanover and Hamburg. There are plenty of calls from Moldova, Belarus and, of course,
Ukraine. Here are just a few examples, and some questions: “Mr President, you
said on April 27 that the procedure for granting Russian citizenship would be
facilitated for all rather than individual groups of Ukrainians. When will you
sign the executive order?” “Will we ever make up with Ukraine? Will we ever
restore ties with Ukraine?” A call from Odessa: “Mr President, will you visit
us in Ukraine?”</p><p>Right now, we have a call from Kiev. They tell me that it is Ukrainian
journalist Valery Shvets.</p><p>Valery, good afternoon.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/4fNJBSNaqzvHIo4FnCGUGNszIshloGBk.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/Vb2MnxXnAfS6NGxBAEDzA7rzDBR2UmiE.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(34, 38, 50);background:linear-gradient(0deg, #222632 0%, rgba(34,38,50,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #9d8d8b 0%, rgba(157,141,139,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #3c7ef8 0%, rgba(60,126,248,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #dad0f2 0%, rgba(218,208,242,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p><b>Valery Shvets:</b> Mr President, good afternoon.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Good afternoon.</p><p><b>Valery Shvets:</b> Do the Minsk talks have a future
after the recent elections in Ukraine? As we know, Viktor Medvedchuk has left
the negotiating group. He said he would carry on independent talks on releasing
detainees regardless of the position of the new Ukrainian authorities. Has
Medvedchuk contacted you on the matter of releasing Ukrainian citizens held in detention
in Russia?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> First of all, we never lose sight
of these matters, especially when it concerns the problems of people in distress, those who are in detention or in other places that are no better than
a prison.</p><p> It is true that Mr Medvedchuk was involved in this
process, both at the request of the former President of Ukraine and on his own.
But initially he was charged with this job by President Poroshenko. It is also
true that Mr Medvedchuk takes all these problems personally, close to heart. He
has been here recently, when he again called for releasing the Ukrainian sailors
who had been detained during the accident near the Kerch Strait. He also called
on us to release several other people who have been sentenced and are serving
their terms in Russia. But these subjects should be regarded as a package.
Before addressing this matter, we must think about those for whom we care,
including Russian citizens, who are suffering the same fate in Ukraine.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>Mr President, we receive many
questions through the social networks.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I am sorry; I just saw a question
from Yakutia, “When will there be a bridge across the Lena River?”</p><p>This is a question that the Russian Government must address together
with Yakutia. This is an expensive project. The problem is, there is nowhere to extend this bridge and this future road. This is why we do not believe that
there could be a return on this investment. Nevertheless, it will be necessary
to address this problem as soon as possible in order for the city to develop.</p><p>Now an unusual question: “Where have the Chud people gone?” They have mostly
become assimilated. Yes. However, I am sure that they have not disappeared
completely. In general, we had many peoples living in the Russian Federation.
Some peoples are still there, some are not, but this is all part of our
cultural code.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>Let us continue. A question we have
received in the VKontakte social network, on the economy: “I would like to ask about
the plans to further develop the Russian economy. Will there be a stronger emphasis
on a market economy? Will we go back to a centralised economy or will we have a kind of mix, which makes the Russian economy stagnate now?” Vasily Buldakov.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>I have a question from a text
message: “Do you understand that we will never have a breakthrough with economists
from the 1990s?”</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>First, we have no economists from the 1990s. Where
are they? Name at least one. Maybe Alexei Kudrin, but not completely; and he
has also changed and I think he has been drifting towards Sergei Glazyev,
because he wants to open our oil treasury and believes that we must raise the cut-off
point for oil revenues. However, his own colleagues, his pupils in a way,
oppose him and say it will result in inflation, and so on. Let them argue.</p><p>But we do not really have any
economists from the 1990s. Some ideas, maybe ones regarding monetary policy, are
there, we can see that, but the economic system of the 1990s is no longer there.
Why? Firstly, we no longer have that level of inflation, which was over 30
percent then, neither do we have that level of debt, which went through the roof. We are not dependent on the IMF. On the contrary, our foreign exchange
reserves are growing, exceeding 500 billion dollars by now, and they continue
to grow. We have no debt – only, unfortunately, some isolated cases of wage
arrears or failure to pay salaries on time.</p><p>But none of this is even close to the 1990s, when salaries were delayed for six months, and military
compensations remained unpaid for months. Pensions were the only reliable source
of income and even they were not paid on time. They were minuscule and were not
paid on time. But there is nothing like that now.</p><p>However, perhaps something else is
more important. The most important thing is that there is no such thing as a pure
market economy or a pure command economy, but a mixture of the two is quite
possible, as the caller said here, and versions of this can be found around the world.</p><p>In general, as soon as any economic
breakdowns begin, as soon as problems arise, the role of the state immediately expands.
But once savings increase, and the situation calms down, the state immediately withdraws
from the economy. This happens everywhere, in all countries. And it always
happened here in times of crises.</p><p>Countries with mixed economies actually
grow faster than others: China, and partly India. In China now, the pace of economic growth is slower than in India, but still it remains one of the drivers of the global economy. And India, too.</p><p>What about the Western economies?
Look, nobody there objects to strategic planning in industry; on the contrary, they
tend to promote it. It is all there, so we need to keep it in mind and use it
too.</p><p> But the main thing that we need to pay attention
to, and yesterday we also discussed this with the Economics Minister, and I completely agree – it is motivation. In whatever system a person works, whether
in a planned or in a market economy, it is necessary to ensure motivation. Only
then will we be able to solve the tasks facing the country.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>Let us continue.

regularly tell Russians about another corrupt official being caught. I recall
Zakharchenko, the Arashukov father and son, among others; and Zakharchenko’s
nine billion is a lorryful of banknotes. Could he really get them without help?</p><p>When answering previous questions,
you spoke about sources of funding. I have a question: where do these billions
come from and, most importantly, where will these confiscated billions go? Who
will be or is responsible for this rampant corruption? As the guarantor of law,
do you feel personally responsible for this mess?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Firstly, I, of course, feel responsible for this mess. If I did not, you
would not know anything, like it happens in some countries still, or like it
used to happen here. You know, there is always an alternative. I am often told
“Perhaps we can hide this” or “Maybe we should close this?” because there will
be questions like yours.</p><p> I always have the same answer: no. If we deal with
crime, with corruption, with dirty money, we must, firstly, go through with
this, and secondly, do it openly. And we will do this and do it openly.</p><p>Where does the money come from?
Clearly, from corruption schemes and from business. Incidentally, both sides
are to blame here: one group of people steal and the other group take bribes.
There are bribers and bribe-takers. And the law says so.</p><p>Where does the money go? To public
revenue, to be sure. Of course, officials, and representatives of law
enforcement in particular, are in a special position and they will always be
under special scrutiny. </p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
When you learned about those stored billions, what words best conveyed your
reaction?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Sometimes it is better not to say them out loud.</p><p>It is not a laughing matter,
actually. In fact, when you learn about these billions, there are no words, at least none fit to go into print. </p><p>To reiterate: this must not deter us
from fighting this phenomenon. Incidentally, this subject occurs in many countries,
practically in all of them. Look at the United States, for one, where
corruption carries 70, 100, or even 150 years of imprisonment. This is
senseless, of course, but the work is carried out in a sufficiently tough manner – and in public. In this country, we will do the same. </p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>
In our country, there are also proposals to punish corruption with life
imprisonment. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You see, the thing is you can sentence a person to life, if he or she
is advanced in years, but dozens of years will not make that much difference. </p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
One has the impression that the authorities are stepping up the fight against
corruption…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> What is important is not even the years of imprisonment. The important
thing is the inevitability of punishment.</p><p> <b>Pavel
Zarubin:</b> The authorities seem to be stepping up the fight against
corruption, but it feels as though its scale is only growing. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>This is only how it feels. In fact, the number of corruption crimes is
declining. And it is declining, I think, largely thanks to our consistent and uncompromising efforts. And we will continue doing this in the future. </p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
We have promised to this studio before the show that we will give them the floor. </p><p>Maria Gladkikh, please.</p><p><b>Maria Gladkikh: </b>Hello, Mr President.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/MgNdKHHcKSh6TfyZyGlEWyWCDa5lkAFq.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/HMYad8i1Nx3uYSNJvFIPBrIt0ByDiQ1s.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(27, 47, 255);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #1b2fff 0%, rgba(27,47,255,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #b4857e 0%, rgba(180,133,126,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #65403c 0%, rgba(101,64,60,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #ebeffc 0%, rgba(235,239,252,0) 100%);" width="386" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image vertical"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>We know that we are living in the Internet era. Actually, we are an Internet generation. All of us have
smartphones and our phones can help us order food or cinema tickets, while the navigator will always show us the way. I see a good-looking girl in this room,
who is taking steps in this direction.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> All girls are good-looking. </p><p><b>Maria
Gladkikh:</b> Right, all girls are good-looking, but this girl
in a blue dress is General Director of the company Yandex, which, one can say,
makes our life easier.</p><p>Good afternoon, Yelena. As I see it, you have decided to keep on going
because there are so many things around.</p><p><b>Yandex Director
General Yelena Bunina:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Good afternoon.</p><p><b>Yelena Bunina:</b> This is what I would like to say.
Ours is a unique country. It is unique also because the technological services
created in Russia are more popular than similar international services. Russia
is actually the only country where this is taking place on the open market
without any harassment of others.</p><p>But we want more at Yandex. We want to become an international high-tech
company that hails from Russia, so that our country feels proud of us and the world admires our cutting-edge technological services. This is becoming
possible.</p><p>For example, our unmanned driving technology is among the best in the world. However, we have a problem with regulatory documents. In the United
States, 1,400 self-driving cars are now being tested on the roads, whereas we
have only launched the first five. Our legal procedure takes too long.</p><p>So here is my question. Do you think our state is capable of taking our
legal procedure one step ahead of the other countries, so that we can surge
ahead in the new technological spheres and become better than anyone else?
Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> This is my dream as well. But we
should take the specific features of our country into account, as you have
said. I love Germany, but you know the saying, “What pleases the Russian kills
the German.” But it can be the other way round as well. Suppose we start using
drones for postal deliveries, as several countries are already doing. Some
people here could use this service, which will be expensive at first, while
those who do not have the money will keep looking at the sky for fear that
something will drop on their heads. No, any innovation must be well prepared.</p><p>On the other hand, we must accelerate to a breakthrough speed. I fully
agree with you on this. That you have reached an agreement with your South
Korean colleagues, who will create self-driving cars based on your “brains” and products, is a step towards making us proud of you. We are proud of you as it
is; yours is a good company. As for whether others admire you or not… at the least, they respect you.</p><p> A few words about admiration: it is something to be
wary of. Everyone admired Huawei and now it has been swatted, quite
unexpectedly. Do you see what I mean? We should remember that, regrettably, unscrupulous
methods of competition are very often used.</p><p>As for development, you know this
terminology: we need to create “sandboxes,” and we are actually doing just this.
In Skolkovo, a testing ground has been built where these unmanned vehicles are
now broken in. Similar facilities should be built in other regions – and expanded.
But of course, we must do it faster. Here I certainly agree with you.</p><p>However, there is something else I would like to emphasise, something you also just mentioned. You said that we
have an open market, and it is not protected. But your company, Yandex,
wonderful as it is, is successfully competing on our market with giants like Google.
Yet, this is not without a touch of state support.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
Mr President, there is another good question. You have partially answered it, but
it is about summing up. How should life be arranged in Russian technology
companies so that our programmers – who are the best in the world, as our young
programmers have won almost every world Olympiad – feel better than in Silicon
Valley?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We need to create a system of preferences, and we are working on this,
including tax preferences. As you may know, high-tech companies enjoy a preferential
status when it comes to making contributions to the social funds.</p><p>There are other support policies, including
direct support: competition for markets, export support and so on. Because we
need our high-tech companies, including software developers, to grow from the Russian
level to an international one; otherwise we will not achieve full success.</p><p>But what is especially important,
and what I would like to point out – and here we need to think together with our
colleagues from the Government – we need to provide a market for our
programmers, especially in sensitive fields: governance, sensitive industries,
say the energy sector, the management system, the financial sector, in our
large companies – to guarantee sovereignty and ensure security.</p><p> And here we have to make decisions at the Government
level, which would… Indeed, they might not be very market-based… someone has asked
here if we have a market economy or not, or where we are heading. But in this
segment, we just need direct Government support to ensure a market for such services.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: There are many business people,

other countries, including Russia. He has a family confectionery factory. Let
me introduce Nikolai Kuzyakov. </p><p>Nikolai, what issues concern small and medium-sized businesses today?</p><p><b>Nikolai Kuzyakov:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President. I have one question and one personal request to make.</p><p>The question is about the oversight authorities. Thank you for what you
have done and for extending the oversight holiday. Indeed, there are fewer
planned inspections, but, regrettably, many more unscheduled inspections. Three
oversight agencies conducted inspections at my company last week. </p><p>As a result, they will probably levy 100-percent fines. If they fail to do that, their higher-ups will say that the inspectors botched their job or that there is a corruption component. </p><p>Small businesses say that, in principle, it is all right that they come
and inspect companies. But they should behave like instructors, assistants and mentors.
They should help us and teach us so we could safely phone and consult them. </p><p>I have a question to ask you, Mr President. Is there a way to induce the oversight authorities to stop imposing fines or seeking out problems? Why
cannot they help small and medium-sized businesses develop? </p><p> And another thing. We met once before and you said
you would taste <i>Vanya’s Sweets</i>, when
you came to Penza. This is the first reason for you to visit us. The second reason
is that we have a strong ice hockey school. The city of Penza has produced many
national players. You play ice hockey in Sochi. Our governor plays hockey, too.
I have a dream: to play with you on a rink in Penza.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Thank you for your invitation.
First of all, I will answer a question I saw there: “Are you a Muscovite or a Russian?” I am a Petersburger. I was born in St Petersburg. It is my homeland,
which is saying something, as I see it.</p><p>The second question is about text messages used for treating children.
It would be better to know where this question came from, because it must be
connected with a problem somewhere, such as an outpatient clinic or its
absence, or even the absence of a rural paramedic centre or an outpatient
station. Unfortunately, it is unclear where this question has come from.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> It most likely concerns the collection of funds for a user’s medical treatment.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We need to consider it.</p><p>“This never happened under Brezhnev.” No, it never did, but many other
things that took place under Brezhnev ultimately led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p><p>Now to your question about inspections. First of all, there are
scheduled inspections. We introduced inspection holidays, but the number of inspections held soared last year because the period of holidays was over.</p><p>It is logical that the agencies making the inspections augmented their
plans to include the companies they had not inspected for several years. This
is why we have extended these holidays for another two years. At the same time,
the number of scheduled inspections has decreased by some 11 percent.</p><p>What can be done to turn the inspecting bodies and their inspectors into
mentors, as you have said, or even assistants?</p><p>Actually, you are perfectly right. This is what we want; we would like it
to be as you have described it. And this is what we encourage the regulatory
bodies, including the prosecutor and tax authorities, to become. </p><p>We have proposed a number of measures, including the so-called mirror
register, to ensure additional control. You have probably heard about this. If
not, I will tell you about it.</p><p>The idea is that not only the inspectors or prosecutor offices keep a register of the inspections, but the companies inspected keep a register as well. In fact, this is what our businesses have proposed.</p><p>They will keep a register of who inspected whom, the reason for the inspection and their results. This information can and will be submitted to the prosecutor’s offices, which will have an additional source of information about
the situation in this sphere.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Mr President, you said many times
that excessive pressure must be lifted from businesses and that there is no
need for excessive inspections. You issued instructions and directives. What do
you feel like when your instructions are not complied with?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Like anyone else who…</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Where are the boundaries of your
patience?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> It is not a matter of boundaries of patience; what we need is to achieve a set goal. And then, frankly speaking, I have answered similar questions many a time. The simplest thing I can do is
raise a ballyhoo, kick out, fire and throw the book at somebody.</p><p> All of these methods can be used in truly
outrageous cases, but I also feel responsible when somebody fails to do
something.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>
Let us give the floor to our guests here. Again, I can see a lot of raised hands.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
About the pressure on business, sorry, I will continue. There is a person here
with us who has experienced this very pressure on himself. He spent several
months in the remand prison before being acquitted. Meet Alexander Khurudzhi.
And now he is also a public ombudsman for the rights of entrepreneurs who are
in custody.</p><p>Alexander, your question to the President, please.</p><p><b>Alexander Khurudzhi:</b> Mr President, good afternoon.</p><p>First, I would like to thank you for having supported me then. And the second point is very important. The number of people ending up in pre-trial detention is on the rise.</p><p>We have made progress in improving
the business climate; indeed, a lot has been done, but, unfortunately, we have
taken a step backwards, and a very big one too, concerning criminal
prosecution. Arrest remains the preferred pre-trial restriction, house arrest
at best, and, consequently, a business owner cannot continue operating, loses
the business, which in most cases goes bankrupt, and people lose their jobs.</p><p>We have a specific proposal, and I know that after Titov’s report you spoke positively of it. It is about changing
the approach to bail, making bail the predominant pre-trial restriction rather
than arrest.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/43Od7kSCxlvoPEeVhttvg0m7rjDrqJbA.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/pso0HFtXnkJkD8XOCxqlW66NwuHMtjWA.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(23, 58, 253);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #173afd 0%, rgba(23,58,253,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #5b616b 0%, rgba(91,97,107,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #a6a8b2 0%, rgba(166,168,178,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #ecf9fd 0%, rgba(236,249,253,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>This will reduce the cases of partners or rivals “setting each other up.” So their number will decline from
the current level of 12 – by the way, not a single person has escaped – and a procedure will be worked out to determine the size of bail in each specific
case. There is international practice: it usually depends on the suspect’s financial
position. In our practice, the alleged damage is picked randomly, and in 80
percent of cases the court orders to compensate a fraction of that amount.</p><p>Therefore, I have a really big
request, as a person who is faced on a daily basis with loads of appeals from
business people around the country to help them and give them a chance to be
released on bail. So far, none of those released has fled.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I would just like to say, you cannot run away from us, we have a long reach.
However, unfortunately, they do run away, you know, and lie low somewhere
abroad. And our so-called partners do not seem to be in any hurry to extradite
anyone, even in absolutely obvious cases of criminal offences, let alone civil litigation.
But this is a separate topic, and it happens that they do extradite someone.</p><p> You are certainly right to say that arrests should not
be overused, especially in cases of economic offences. Here I fully agree with
you. You have probably heard what I said in my Address this year, and this is
exactly what I said then.</p><p>Can bail be used for pre-trial
restriction more widely? Yes, it can, and it should be. Along with house
arrest, or travel restrictions – all these options need to be used more widely,
I agree.</p><p>Yet, it is not possible to exclude
arrest from the options altogether – I understand that you do not mean that. But
this way wealthy people would be able to avoid arrest indefinitely by paying, so
that ordinary citizens now listening to us, and millions of people are indeed listening,
would say, hey, this sounds like if he is rich, he can do whatever he pleases, then
pay his way out and avoid any responsibility.</p><p>This cannot be allowed either. Moderation
is needed in everything. And bail should certainly be more widely used as a restrictive measure, I have no doubt.</p><p>One of the main problems today is long
remand. I have already asked the Prosecutor General’s Office and the Supreme
Court to analyse the situation and make some proposals.</p><p>There are varying terms; but I would
like to adjust these terms and ask both agencies (the Prosecutor General’s
Office and the Supreme Court) to submit their proposals by the end of the year,
better still by late November or early December.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>
Mr President, we also have a request from business leaders to streamline the application of Article 210 of the Criminal Code on criminal organisations,
because this article is being actively applied.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, I fully agree. I do not even want to comment on this, just that I agree. We absolutely need to work at the expert level here, including the Legal
Department and the Presidential Executive Office, and the Duma members should also
think about it.</p><p> The current legal procedure prescribed by law is
such – and by legal procedure I mean a statement of the essence of the problem – that almost anything can qualify as a criminal organisation, even the board
of directors of a company, if at least one of the members has been caught
violating the law. And this, of course, is unacceptable; it is an absolutely
obvious fact and we need to deal with it and make changes to the current law.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
People have recalled the 1990s several times today. In August, we will mark 20years since the tragic events of August 1999, when militants led by Basayev and Khattab invaded Daghestan. The local residents were the first to stand up to them.</p><p>Today, we will not ignore Daghestan,
of course. We are in direct contact with our correspondent Alexander Sladkov in Daghestan. </p><p><b>Alexander Sladkov:</b> We are in Botlikh. Hello. </p><p>This is an area high in the mountains. It is raining now. We were worried and wondered if we would be able
to show the surrounding stupendous beauty. But the clouds are clearing up and you can see the legendary village of Botlikh below. </p><p>There was fierce fighting here 20
years ago. This hollow was engulfed in flames. After choosing this spot for our
report, we saw shell casings under our feet. Everything reminds you of the war here.
These mountains were seized by the militants. Interior Ministry special forces,
now the Russian Guard, landed here.</p><p>This is Mount Alilen that was
stormed by the paratroops; blood was spilled here, there were casualties, but
the paratroopers took the height, and the infantry, the gunners, and the airmen
were shooting. But the first shot was fired at the militants – there were over a thousand of them, they were international terrorists led by Basayev and Khattab
(all sorts came here) – the first shot was fired by the local militia. </p><p>We have here with us some
participants in those events, people, who despite the danger to themselves and their families, despite the possible negative consequences, took up arms and fought alongside the Russian police, security personnel and the military.</p><p>Mr President, they would like to ask
you a question.</p><p><b>Question:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President. We remember the day
you came to Botlikh by plane at a very difficult time for us. In Botlikh, the local militia was fighting and defending their land and Russia. And now I would
like to say the following. We saw wounded and dead militiamen here. But even
today – I would like to tell you – they have no status as participants in hostilities. I would like to ask you, Mr President, to resolve this – not for us
or for someone else, but for Daghestan and Russia’s future, for the sake of our
grandchildren.</p><p>One more question. Do you remember
how, in a military tent, we raised our glasses to victory? We were all standing
next to you and wanted to drink up, but you said – later. Now Botlikh is
flourishing; we have gas, running water, and it is beautiful here. Allow us to raise our glasses to your health and to victory. Thank you. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> As for toasts, I hope we will be able to do this with you. In fact, it
would be interesting to find out whether our latest decisions on Botlikh, agreed
upon during my last visit to Daghestan, have been carried out or not.</p><p>Regarding those events, they are in my memory for the rest of my life. I remember how the people of Daghestan acted.
I remember how all this happened. I remember people coming to me… It might be
unusual for the country to hear, but I will recall it, how people from Daghestan
addressed me and said, If Russia is unwilling or unable to defend itself or us,
give us weapons. I also remember a different situation, when the village heads
came to our military – when the forces arrived – and said why aren’t you using
artillery? And the Russian commander replied, your houses are there, it would
be a shame to destroy them because it takes generations to build houses in the mountains. And I was struck by their reply: don’t feel bad, just do it.</p><p>And it was like this not only in Botlikh
but also in other villages too. For example, I remember Tsumandinsky District
where the local residents simply refused to allow these criminals to enter
their area. It was the same in other villages as well; people took up arms and defended their towns, as you said, they defended themselves, their birthplaces
and the whole of Russia against these international terrorist groups. These
were international groups that were, incidentally, well-armed and well-trained.
</p><p>The Constitutional Court has passed
a ruling on this subject and said that the current law makes it possible to adopt a decision of this kind at the regional level. Well, I understand that
the republic just lacks the funds. So, I agree with you and fully support you,
that this decision must be made. This is a simple act: the militia members must
be put on the list of the law now in effect in Russia, which will immediately
give you and your militia comrades the same status as veterans of military
operations. I am instructing the Government to do this and do it as soon as possible. The problem is how to compile the lists. But I do not think this will
be too difficult. What I mean is that these people, thank God, are alive and in good health, and you will help us with it.</p><p> Thank you.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Let us continue.</p><p>Back in 1999, you went to Daghestan as prime minister. The country was
falling apart. Several months later, President Boris Yeltsin resigned, shifting
the responsibility for the country on to you. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> What do you mean he shifted responsibility?
He resigned, and I agreed to become acting president. I had to do this.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> If you could go back 20 years,
would you make the same decision?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I have said many times that when
Boris Yeltsin offered this to me, I replied that I was not ready for it, that I never thought I would do this. But ultimately, I agreed.</p><p>As you said, and as the veterans of those hostilities have reminded us,
the country was in critical condition. Had the terrorists reached their goals
in Daghestan, it would have created system-wide problems for the whole of the North
Caucasus and subsequently for the Volga region. This is something we must never
forget. But we managed to avoid it; we preserved our sovereignty and territorial integrity, partly due to people like the ones we see on this screen
today. Trust me, it was vital to do this then. What mattered was not the combat
might of these volunteers, but their spirit and desire to preserve the country.
It was a milestone, an absolutely key milestone event. I am deeply grateful to those Daghestanis and to Daghestan for taking a stand, then and now.</p><p>Therefore, the only possible answer to your question is, “Yes, of course.” Especially since we did this by working together and with the support of the whole country.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/dLxwYl4izV8DDMyoK92FyRSIeCUdzaDo.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/V6TZgyMn17UFESKqXzQ5nSQf4T6Qbp6r.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(64, 49, 44);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #40312c 0%, rgba(64,49,44,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #91635e 0%, rgba(145,99,94,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #17205d 0%, rgba(23,32,93,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #778993 0%, rgba(119,137,147,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> Mr President, let us listen to those who are here in this room. They have a lot of questions. Olga Pautova,
please.</p><p><b>Olga Pautova:</b> Many questions have to do with
healthcare. You could see at the beginning of this event, my colleagues showed
you hospitals that have many problems. People turn to these hospitals for help,
they want to get better. I would like to look at this issue from a different
angle: some 1.3 million people who seek medical assistance in Russia every year
are terminally ill. </p><p>But this does not mean that we cannot help them. I will give the floor
now to Nyuta Federmesser, the founder of the Vera Hospice Charity Fund.
Thanks to this fund, the country has learned about palliative care for the terminally ill. Over the past three months, Nyuta has been travelling
across the country and visiting hospices. She knows everything about the problems of palliative care.</p><p>Nyuta, please sit down and take the floor.</p><p><b>Anna Federmesser:</b> Thank you.</p><p>Indeed, I have been travelling for three months now. This story from Daghestan is incredibly touching – just
recently, I have visited Daghestan with the Russian Popular Front’s project
called The Care Region – which is why I cannot help but digress from my question and comment on this. These people are absolutely wonderful.</p><p>In Daghestan, no one needs a reminder that people should pass away at home and that the elderly should be at home, that this is natural and normal, because everyone there takes people from
hospital back home. Absolutely everyone, always. Even if someone passes away at a psychoneurological residential care facility that the relatives took them to back in their childhood, he or she is taken back home.</p><p>I have to say that I saw a similar
wonderful facility with the Miloserdiye [Mercy] department in the city of Buynaksk; it had a wonderful warm, homey, truly Caucasian atmosphere. But at the same time, there is not a single home-visit palliative care service in Daghestan.
They are trying hard to make it happen, want to make it happen and are trying
to. We tried as well. I am sure that we will continue working with the governor
and the authorities on this.</p><p>Just recently, a girl named Patimat
was brought there from Moscow. Her mother Marjanat wanted to move there as well, but, let us put it like this, she stayed home in Makhachkala.
Unfortunately, only after our appeal to the local authorities was a home-visit care
service for her organised, because there is no such system there yet. We will
work on it in Daghestan and everywhere possible, because it is very important.
Thank you.</p><p>My question, however, concerns a completely different topic. When you run around the country like this with
three key messages that you have talked about – that there must be
accessibility, trained experts and medication supply. It seems that palliative
care will become accessible, the experts will, hopefully, complete their
training; there will be medicines, the money for medication was allocated,
everything was purchased. But why is there such a great number of patients not
receiving pain management, why does this suffering remain?</p><p>Because there is one more factor
that does not deal with the healthcare system directly. This is the medical professionals’
fear of using opioid analgesics. The Interior Ministry says that there are not
many cases of prosecuted doctors, medical professionals. Not many cases, but
there are some, nevertheless. That is how we work, all of us – you make a public example of one person who is punished, and thousands live in fear.</p><p> Prosecution of doctors – medical professionals, not
just doctors – is regulated by the Criminal Code, article 228.2, section one.
This is a very interesting article establishing criminal liability regardless
of consequences, whether any harmful effects followed or not, whether they were
dangerous or not. This means, the drug did not find its way to the illicit
market, did not cause harm to health, but a mistake was made in the procedure –
a mere formality: say, the entry was made at the wrong time, with the wrong
pen, the entry form was wrong, the ampoule fell down and rolled under the safe,
and it could only be retrieved the next day. </p><p>When you ask doctors, “Why are you
not managing the pain? There is a patient in pain there”, they reply with “You
know how it is with drugs.” I hear this all the time. We held surveys via the Vera
and Gift of Life foundations. We have been talking about this for five years,
really, each time with another agency, and they keep telling us: “Yes, of course, we must decriminalise this article, we definitely must.” But it seems
to me that we need someone on the inside when all agencies come together, who
would finally advocate this.</p><p>There are other offences in the Criminal Code, such as 228.1 and 229, which concern selling drugs – and this
happens, unfortunately, truth to be told, some drugs find their way to the illicit market. If the medical professional is the one to blame, there are
other statutes. If we must prosecute medical professionals for formal errors,
we will never solve the personnel problem that today’s Direct Line basically
began with. </p><p> <b>Olga
Pautova:</b> Back to the question please, Nyuta.</p><p><b>Anna Federmesser</b>: My question is, essentially, a request. I ask you to support the complete decriminalisation of medical professionals’ liability under article
228.2, because there are other articles for those who really are guilty, and they must not escape justice.</p><p>It seems to me that for death to no
longer be described in Russia as a “merciful release”, for people to pass away
instead of dying in agony, one has to, unfortunately, appeal to Direct Line
again, sorry to say. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes indeed, this problem is known. You are right, decisions have to be
taken. Look, if an ampoule with a narcotic substance rolls under something, as you said, it naturally has to be retrieved, if it simply rolled away. That is
the first thing.</p><p>The second thing. Unfortunately,
there are violations in this sphere as well; there are cases of these
medications finding their way to the illicit market, and we must keep in mind
that this happens. But you are absolutely right about the fact that it must not
destabilise the entire system’s operation.</p><p>And when something obviously gets
lost, it is not even about the ampoule rolling under something, it can even get
stepped on accidentally; sometimes, patients get prescriptions not according to medical regulations – four injections instead of two or three, which is a deviation from the regulation.</p><p>And doctors must not be liable for this, you are absolutely right. But here, like in some other cases, the solution, as I see it, is very simple; it does not even require any major
change.</p><p>One needs to keep a record of such
losses or when more is used than the regulation provides for, in some document to be signed by not only the doctor or the nurse, but, say, a hospital
administrator or the chief of medicine. We simply need to develop a system for reporting and record keeping.</p><p>And if someone tries to cheat under this
system, or profit off it, this will be a criminal case that must be dealt with
separately. </p><p> And Ms Golikova [Deputy Prime Minister] is on the line right now, she is listening, but there is no need for comment. I ask her to pay attention to this and take action, and develop a corresponding proposal.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>
Mr President, I would like to say a bit more about the anti-narcotics article.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, just a second, please.</p><p>Before we started discussing
narcotics, I did not have time to write down the name of the village in Orenburg Region where a school has not been renovated for 50 years. Will you be
able to find its name later on?</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>
Trudovoye village. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Right, Trudovoye. I will certainly discuss the matter with the governor, and, naturally, we will try and help. </p><p>Anyuta has discussed doctor training
programmes here. This is very important for the sphere you mentioned and also
in general. When we talked about healthcare, it goes without saying that, on the one hand, it is necessary to streamline the system for training specialists
and constantly improving their skills. On the other hand, there needs to be
oversight of advanced training programmes and this entire process. As a matter
of fact, the Ministry of Healthcare is now dealing with this matter.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/rivnxTKUfzL6SVPiMtxdydUAg5d14cjN.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/QqoWPPA7LtFDXrROBpJ7nwt52Jm6jwAX.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(33, 50, 254);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #2132fe 0%, rgba(33,50,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #e9eefb 0%, rgba(233,238,251,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #898c93 0%, rgba(137,140,147,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #010412 0%, rgba(1,4,18,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>
Once again, speaking of article 228 that deals with narcotics, many people have
been sentenced in Russia. And most of them say that police had planted the drugs in order to prove their guilt. </p><p>Perhaps it is now time to introduce
some amendments to this part of the Criminal Code’s article that stipulates
liability for narcotics possession.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Indeed, many people are sentenced for violating statutes on narcotics distribution.
Moreover, people sentenced under articles linked with the illegal distribution of narcotics and preparations and their precursors account for some 26 percent of all prison inmates.</p><p>Should we liberalise this sphere? I do not think so because this country, our nation and our people are facing a tremendous threat. Anyone illegally possessing, transporting and selling even
small amounts of drugs must bear the consequences for this, and there can be no
liberalisation here.</p><p>On the other hand, we need to establish oversight of the operations of law enforcement agencies, so that they
do not violate the law in any way, so that they do not arrest people for the sake of meeting preset targets, and so that there are no incidents like the one
involving that journalist that you have mentioned.</p><p>By the way, the generals were
dismissed for this, and I hope that the required investigative activities will
be duly conducted to expose all the culprits who created this abnormal
situation. </p><p>I repeat, the most important thing
is that we need to establish oversight. Therefore, I will think about this, and I will have another conversation with the Prosecutor-General’s Office and the Interior Ministry. Maybe, the Interior Ministry’s internal affairs division should
set up an independent specialised office that would monitor this sphere of activity. And the Federal Security Service ought to address this matter more
actively.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
Back to the calls.</p><p>A word from Tatyana Remezova.</p><p><b>Tatyana Remezova:</b> Three new laws, pased this spring, have sparked a lot of questions and criticism, especially in the internet community. Here is one typical text
message about the law against insulting the authorities: “Do the officials
differ in any way from other citizens of our country? Are they grown in incubators, or maybe delivered from Mars?”</p><p>This topic has also hit the blogosphere. A popular social media person, a founder of the MDK project with
10 million followers, which is a big audience, Roberto Panchvidze, will join us
by videoconference. We hope to see him on the screen right now.</p><p>Roberto, hello. You are on air, please
ask your question.</p><p><b>Roberto Panchvidze:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President.</p><p>My name is Roberto Panchvidze, I am
the chief administrator and editor of the MDK community.</p><p>Since I deal mainly with young
people and the internet, I will be more comfortable talking about things I can
relate to and what hurts us specifically.</p><p>On March 18, you signed a law on disrespect
for the authorities. Apart from the media, this affects the internet. In our
country, the internet is more than a list of social media or services. The internet
in Russia is, first of all, people. People who have a need to speak out, who
feel a growing social tension, who are looking for a place where they can let it
all out.</p><p>So they have been doing this openly and,
most importantly, safely on the internet for some time. Now, because of this
law, we all as internet users are in great danger. I would like to ask you to monitor
the enforcement of this law and take it under control, so the situation with that
infamous article No. 282 is not repeated. The prerequisites for this are in place.</p><p>Just a few days ago, in Arkhangelsk Region
alone, this new law resulted in six people being penalised – six people –
because of their comments in a group on VKontakte. One woman was fined because
of her comment, I will quote it verbatim: “They’ve got some nerve!”</p><p> I do not know what the situation with the other
five is, but I would say some clearly defined boundaries are needed, some line drawn
between insult and criticism, so that people are able to fully understand and comply with this law, and the authorities will not be able to abuse it. Thank
you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I see what this is about. This law is not about criticising the authorities.
On the contrary, it should be freer; people have the right and must focus
attention on problems, including those in the functioning of government
institutions. This goes without saying.</p><p>The law has a different aim. It is
designed to fight the desecration of state symbols; in fact, of our nation and each one of us, so that nobody could mock the flag, the emblem and so on. This
is what it is about, and such things happen; we cannot let them go unnoticed. </p><p>Moreover, this practice is not confined
to Russia. Many countries even have criminal liability for this; for example,
it is punished by several years in prison in Germany. In Russia, administrative
liability has just been introduced for this. There is nothing unusual here.</p><p>But something I must agree with you
is that you are absolutely right that no one has the right to abuse this law in order to restrict people’s rights to criticise the current government at any
level, by the way.</p><p>Of course, we will monitor this. I will ask the General Prosecutor’s Office to monitor this carefully. Enforcement
must be in keeping with the spirit and the letter of the law.</p><p><b>Roberto Panchvidze: </b>Thank you very much.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Thank you.</p><p><b>Tatyana Remezova: </b>There has been a big response on the blogosphere: four million views on OK
Live 4, so the internet is with us, too.</p><p>Another blogger has just contacted us.
It is pundit and author Dmitry Puchkov, better known as Goblin in the internet
world.</p><p>Mr Puchkov, you have the floor. I understand you have a question about the law on fake news.</p><p><b>Dmitry Puchkov: </b>Good afternoon, Mr President.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Good afternoon.</p><p><b>Dmitry Puchkov: </b>My name is Dmitry Puchkov.</p><p>The growth of the internet and social networks has destroyed many barriers that had previously stopped all manner
of lies, and now anyone can, pardon me, rave and call it news: the end of the world is coming here in Dzerzhinsk, or a man was buried alive. It is a trend to call such made-up news “fake”.</p><p>It is well known that our people are
credulous, often naïve, especially on the internet. Young people readily believe
any fiction and argue themselves hoarse, saying, “I know it’s true, I read it
on the internet.” While in the West, I agree, they even have criminal liability
for spreading video clips. For example, they can get real prison time in New
Zealand.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/BfdARGvdxbLkqK5A0Ue6ua6eOK3Ii9sC.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/c3CAeQSfk5qSpWlnEA8OB0EF2PyxDH6c.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(48, 81, 255);background:linear-gradient(0deg, #3051ff 0%, rgba(48,81,255,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #ac837d 0%, rgba(172,131,125,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #dfe1ec 0%, rgba(223,225,236,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #542335 0%, rgba(84,35,53,0) 100%);" width="386" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image vertical"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p> Here is my question. Isn’t it time to introduce
stricter criminal liability for spreading fake news in Russia?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
You know, we did not have any liability at all. I think administrative liability
was introduced, but the problem is there and becoming increasingly urgent. </p><p>You mentioned Dzerzhinsk but there
are other examples. When we were sitting in my office, preparing for today’s
event, the heads of our main channels – both Channel One and VGTRK – said they had
receive calls about mines and bombs. But this is not limited to TV channels. Companies,
transport facilities, shopping centres, including large malls, also receive calls
and other information to this effect. Incidentally, this leads to huge losses and could trigger serious concern in society as a whole.</p><p>You mentioned Dzerzhinsk where information
about higher radiation or something else are being spread. But I would like to emphasize
right away so everyone understands what the problem is. This is not simply
about spreading information but about the deliberate dissemination of fake
information. This is what this law is all about.</p><p>Let us consider law enforcement actions,
how this is being handled everyday and then decide whether it is enough or if something
else has to be done in this respect. Thank you.</p><p><b>Tatyana Remezova:</b> Thank you.</p><p>The DDoS-attacks on our call centre continue,
but we are dealing with them. As you can see, the application works and we
continue receiving video calls.</p><p>The law on a sovereign internet will
also come into force in Russia on November 1. Yet another blogger with a million followers has gotten through to us now. He has created one of the most
popular YouTube channels with 7 million followers. This
is Amiran Sardarov.</p><p>Good afternoon, Amiran. You are on the air; we are waiting for your
question.</p><p><b>Amiran Sardarov:</b> Good afternoon. Do you hear me?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> We do. Good afternoon. </p><p><b>Amiran Sardarov:</b> One of the main topics online today is the law on a sovereign internet.
It may look as if we are again trying to isolate ourselves from the outside
world with an iron curtain. Bloggers and users are perplexed. They do not
understand why this is being done. Can you tell us honestly why this law was adopted?</p><p>Before you reply, I would like to say that my shawarma is the best in Moscow. I invite all of you to try it. Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> All right. Well done.</p><p><b>Tatyana Remezova:</b> Everyone wants to feed you. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
He took this opportunity to promote his product and this was the right thing to do. But what was his question?</p><p><b>Tatyana Remezova:</b> About the sovereign internet. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> About the sovereign internet. Listen, this is not at all about
restrictions on the internet. We talked about the Chinese company Huawei. The US decided to restrict its activities because most of its servers are abroad. Naturally,
I hope this will not happen; they will not figure it out, because this would
destroy their own system. But if we assume in theory that these servers are switched
off or their performance is affected, we must, with this and other cases,
ensure the reliable operation of runet, the Russian segment of the internet.
This is the goal that is pursued by this law. This is the only goal. No restrictions are envisioned. On the contrary, this law is designed to ensure the sovereignty of our internet and the opportunity for everyone to work in it: individuals, bloggers and state
organisations alike.</p><p> As for the invitation, thank you very much. </p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> Recently you signed an executive order to simplify the procedure for obtaining Russian citizenship, which many Donbass
residents were long looking forward to. The refugees from the people’s republics

Lyulkovich, refitted to use as a workshop. Here we can see work materials and toolboxes

please show me what you have here.</p><p><b>Yekaterina Lyulkovich:</b> This is a shell that fell on the grounds of our school.</p><p><b>Yegor Kolyvanov: </b>Fragments. </p><p><b>Yekaterina Lyulkovich:</b> Yes, shell fragments. </p><p><b>Yegor Kolyvanov: </b>The most telling argumentthat explains why the family has moved from the area.</p><p>Vladimir, you
have been trying to get Russia citizenship since 2014, but, as far as I understand, you have not managed to obtain anything better than refugee status.
Why? </p><p><b>Vladimir Lyulkovich:</b> Because I have a large family. My wife had to apply for temporary refugee status, which practically does not help
in any way because of taxes, so it is like a vicious circle. She had five minor
dependent children and it was difficult to declare income for tax purposes. Do you
understand? </p><p><b>Yegor Kolyvanov:</b> Yes, you mean it was difficult to legally get
a job to certify her income.</p><p><b>Vladimir Lyulkovich:</b> To get a higher status you have to declare your income for the previous year. It is a vicious circle she cannot break.
</p><p><b>Yegor Kolyvanov:</b> Of course, it is important to explain that Dzerzhinsk
was part of the Donetsk People’s Republic for about four months but now it is under
the control of the Ukrainian armed forces, so officially it is not part of the Donetsk
People’s Republic. </p><p>You have a family of 11 and you are not the only ones who came to Naberezhnyye Chelny from
Dzerzhinsk. Who are your guests today? Are these people your relatives? </p><p><b>Vladimir Lyulkovich:</b> This is the husband of our eldest daughter
and his family, including his brother, his brother’s family and their mother. </p><p><b>Yegor Kolyvanov:</b> Do you have the same living conditions here? </p><p><b>Remark:</b> Yes, we have the same problems and sometimes
they are even worse. My brother and I had temporary residence permits, and once
both of us were fined and held at a temporary detention centre for foreign
nationals.</p><p><b>Yegor Kolyvanov:</b> Until you were granted refugee status. </p><p>It is clear
why the family does not want to go back – Richard told me that at home they sent
him call-up papers.</p><p><b>Richard Lyulkovich:</b> Every two months our neighbour retrieves my call-up papers tucked in the door. They come and ask where we are, where we are
hiding and who knows where we are. But we do not want to go back and kill our
people.</p><p><b>Yegor Kolyvanov:</b> It is clear why they are trying to enlist you
in military service.</p><p>The problem
is clear. Your living conditions here are difficult. The children go to school
but, of course, you are not eligible for other social guarantees. </p><p>You can ask
the President a question. </p><p><b>Vladimir Lyulkovich:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Good afternoon.</p><p><b>Vladimir Lyulkovich:</b> Mr President, on April 29 you signed an executive order on simplifying
procedures for receiving citizenship for the residents of some territories of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions, who live in the Russian Federation. But this
law does not cover me, my family and thousands of people from other territories
of Donbass, who live in Russia.</p><p>We are asking you for help in receiving
citizenship because, as you know, hope dies last. Please explain what we could expect
from you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I have already spoken about this but would like to repeat it. You
mentioned the April 29 Executive Order. There are also other regulations that
allow Ukrainian citizens living in Russia to receive citizenship under a simplified
procedure. I will see how this works in practice. </p><p>This is a regulation that was adopted
recently. I already know that there is a problem linked with demands for certain documents that Ukrainian citizens can only get in Ukraine. Clearly,
this is a vicious circle. It is hardly possible to resolve this problem. Therefore,
I will see what adjustments and additions should be made to the regulatory base
so that this problem is resolved in practical terms rather than based on papers
that are impossible to get.</p><p>Mr Minnikhanov [President of the Republic of Tatarstan] is listening to this. I will talk to him to find out
what else should be done to resolve this problem in your case, and as soon as possible. A decision on your family and the family of your relatives will be made
quickly and then we will see in general what changes should be made to the regulatory
base to make this process as liberal as possible for other Ukrainian citizens
on Russian territory. In fact, I have already said that this is not even
limited to those who are on Russian territory.</p><p>In reviewing this information, I came
across many questions from Ukrainian citizens who are not on the territory of the Russian Federation. They are abroad, including the territory of Ukraine. To receive Russian citizenship they will still have to come to the Russian
Federation. I can hardly imagine how they would be able to simply contact our
consular offices in Ukraine and resolve this issue under current conditions.
That said, we will try to liberalise this process and make it as accessible to Ukrainians as possible.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> This question was received via the VKontakte social networking service: ”You do not speak with Zelensky. But you must understand that it is difficult for him; he is young and does not have enough skills. You could make the first step.“ </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You know, we have just watched this video. I can say in this regard that he is a talented person. I remember his performance on the KVN comedy show in Moscow back in the mid-2000s. It was clever and funny. But what we have just seen is not funny. This is not a comedy; this is tragedy. And now that he has found himself in this position and has become the president of a state, he must solve these problems, especially as he repeatedly spoke about it during his election campaign and made it his core theme. </p><p>But what is happening now? When visiting Paris, he said he was not going to speak with the separatists, that is, with representatives of these unrecognised republics. Then how do you solve this issue? There are no cases in modern history when conflicts of this kind have been settled without a direct dialogue between the conflicting parties. This is simply not possible. Moreover, there has been an increase in shelling by Ukraine's Armed Forces. However, during the election campaign, he stated that the shelling would be stopped and the blockade lifted. This is a direct violation of the Minsk Agreements, which say that the economic ties of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics with Ukraine must be restored. Nothing is being done, and the blockade is only getting worse. Making conciliatory gestures is the simplest thing to do. The Ukrainian leadership needs to exercise its political will. </p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/SkREUgrwlQyNPuLdcu8RAjXiyAMyBvNQ.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/O1GA6s5lhH6PaISlWukyqIOuHOdei9Dm.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(40, 72, 253);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #2848fd 0%, rgba(40,72,253,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #705f65 0%, rgba(112,95,101,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #a4b9bb 0%, rgba(164,185,187,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #0f1019 0%, rgba(15,16,25,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> Mr President, I will go on regarding our closest neighbour, Belarus. You have spoken on this topic, though.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I beg your pardon, but here is an important question on the growing cost of housing and utility services.</p><p>We will get back to this. I will not go into detail, but I want those asking this question – and there are plenty of such questions – to know that they remain under the control of the Government and my personal control. There are limitations to the growth in housing and utility service rates, but efforts should be made to monitor compliance with these restrictions at the regional level. I will task the Government with establishing proper regulation in this sphere. </p><p>Here is a rhetorical question: “There
is no way back to socialism, and capitalism has not given me anything. Why did
they not ask the people?” To begin with, people were asked about this in the early
1990s and although 74 percent voted to preserve the Soviet Union (by the way,
later on nobody recalled this fact for some reason), the RSFSR Supreme Soviet
actually voted to dissolve it. These people were representatives of the nation and this is how they voted. Incidentally, as I see it, this question was asked by a leftist, maybe a Communist Party supporter. But who dissolved the Soviet Union
if not the Communist Party? This is exactly how it was done. Both General
Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Mikhail Gorbachev, and his then
opponent, came from the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee. So what? What is
the question? </p><p>Is it possible to return to full-scale socialism? I personally think this is unlikely, simply unlikely,
because the country has changed. This is only possible through grievous
domestic conflict. Do we need such conflict? I do not rule out that political
forces with leftist views and socialist ideas can control the country and the supreme political power.</p><p>By conducting an open political discussion
and addressing the people, the population, the voters, any legal political force
is capable of winning their sympathies and establishing itself in the upper
echelons of power. Will this be good for the country? I do not know because it
is one thing to nationalise everything and another thing to make nationalised
industries work well. These are completely different things. As for the elements of state influence and state regulation, they are present in this
country anyway. This is a separate big discussion.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>
Let us continue about Belarus.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, please.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>
There are very many questions. I will read them from the website. When will
Russia and Belarus unite in a real union state? There is a proposal to put this
question to the people and even to hold a referendum. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> The question of uniting as a single state is not on our agenda today.
The matter deals with the implementation of the treaty that was signed many
years ago about the formation of a so-called Union State. This is not a single
state; this is not the same thing. But, indeed, there are many elements there, up
to the formation of a union parliament, the introduction of a common currency
and the like. Some things were not done by Russia, Russia delayed them, and other
things were not done by Belarus. </p><p>I have now agreed with Mr Lukashenko
that we will return to this treaty and look together at what should be done
from what was not done and what should be adjusted accordingly. Now expert groups
formed at the level of prime minister and deputy prime minister are actively dealing
with this issue. </p><p>Incidentally, much has already been done,
for instance, on social issues, on the free movement of goods and services and on social guarantees on both sides. Much has been done but in my view, this is
obviously not enough. We can and must do a great deal more.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>Let us get back to domestic affairs. One of the objectives you set for our national programmes was to promote air routes without
stop-overs in Moscow.
We can see that things have started moving in this direction. They might not be
moving as fast as we want them to, but the domestic network is definitely
growing.</p><p>We are
flying to Gorno-Altaisk where our correspondent Dmitry Petrov is on the line.</p><p><b>Dmitry Petrov:</b> We are at Gorno-Altaisk Airport where an L-410
plane with 17 passengers has just landed. It made the flight from Novosibirsk. Indeed, the plane
is small but quite comfortable and, most importantly, it makes regular flights to Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk; these are direct flights,
not through Moscow, as was the case before.</p><p>The Gorno-Altaisk
Airport was rebuilt in 2011 after being out of operation for 20 years. They
built a new runway, which is one kilometer longer than the old one, a new
terminal and a new traffic control tower, and they installed new navigation
equipment.</p><p>All types of mid-range aircraft can land here. You can see a Sukhoi Superjet in the parking
area farther on. It makes charter flights for one of Russia’s leading companies. It has
brought company employees who will spend their holidays in the Altai Mountains. Closer to us, you can see a very small private
plane.</p><p>On some
days, the parking area is full because several flights have been added. Of course,
people are enthusiastic about going to the Altai Mountains.
This was primarily done for tourism, so every year new flights are launched.
Russians who have dreamt of traveling to the Altai Mountains can finally have
their dream come true.</p><p>In 2011, when
the airport reopened, it handled 1.35 million tourists, and now the figure is
over 2 million. Today, in June, campsites in the valley along the Katun River
are full. Of course, Russians can now fly to the Altai Mountains to feed on the energy of the place. As for the local people, this means higher wages and new
jobs.</p><p>You can see the ground service staff
maintaining a plane. Many of them have only been working there for a few months.
Let us ask them.</p><p>Good afternoon. Tell us about your
job, please. What do you do to maintain the plane?</p><p><b>Remark: </b>Maintenance
includes checking all the navigation systems and fueling it. </p><p><b>Dmitry Petrov: </b>When will it be fueled?</p><p><b>Remark: </b>The plane has just arrived, and it leaves tomorrow, so it will be fueled tomorrow.</p><p><b>Dmitry Petrov: </b>I believe airfare to Novosibirsk is 3,800 – this is a bit closer, and 4,900 to Krasnoyarsk. How do people like these prices?</p><p><b>Remark: </b>They
think it is a bit too expensive. This is too expensive for our people, of course. Wages are not very high here, and we have to travel a lot everywhere.</p><p><b>Dmitry Petrov: </b>But it is convenient.</p><p><b>Remark: </b>It
is convenient.</p><p><b>Dmitry Petrov: </b>Look, new routes are launched every year. Now there are five. This year
we opened Yekaterinburg, Kazan, Moscow, Novosibirsk and Krasnoyarsk. Will you be
able to manage 25 flights instead of just five?</p><p><b>Remark:</b> Yes,
of course we will.</p><p><b>Remark: </b>Airport
capacity is 155 people per hour, so we will, even if there are 25 flights.</p><p><b>Dmitry Petrov: </b>And the local authorities, the regional authorities, of course, have
plans to develop air links to remote districts, such as Kosh-Agach and Ust-Koksa mainly; it takes all of 24 hours of driving on mountain roads to get
there, or only a 90-minute to two-hour flight.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/UAH5KUWAnAN8WB8N4dZvbPSry6FAOA2G.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/A3Pp20ZAi44FvtHWhFOEwwlEhPs934iH.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(22, 30, 74);background:linear-gradient(270deg, #161e4a 0%, rgba(22,30,74,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #70abf2 0%, rgba(112,171,242,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #f1ffff 0%, rgba(241,255,255,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #9e6460 0%, rgba(158,100,96,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>And, of course, people living in Siberian and Far Eastern areas, where cities and villages are separated by great
distances, dream about the development of regional aviation. Regional aviation
alone can decrease these distances. And, of course, everyone hopes it will be
like in Gorno-Altaisk: new airports with new runways, and new planes and, most
importantly, reasonable fares.</p><p>You know, some airlines in Chukotka,
Kamchatka, Yakutia and Khabarovsk Territory have set very high prices for one-hour flights, like 20,000, 30,000, even 50,000 per passenger, which is very
high, to put it mildly. Everyone is hoping that the systematic development of regional aviation will improve the situation.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>Regarding this airport, I know it well; to tell the truth, it was built on my direct instructions, because the only way to fly
there was from Barnaul, and this did not promote the potential for tourism. It
is huge, really enormous there. And I am happy to hear that tourism has
increased significantly. This is exactly what we wanted to achieve.</p><p>But with regard to air transportation,
it is in fact growing, it has grown lately. While the fact that airfares or, that
is, the cost of plane tickets is increasing, is not good. The government, of course, is taking the necessary steps. What are these steps? First, we have retained
the VAT on all flights, including those via Moscow. And the VAT on flights that
do not go through Moscow has been suspended – it is zero – to stimulate
interregional routes. This is a good measure in general.</p><p>However, other problems came up.
They are primarily related to expenses on plane maintenance at airports. And I also believe that the cost of aviation fuel is another big problem. What is the source of this? This problem really exists because the government has begun to exercise a so-called tax maneuver. In other words, we have begun to change
export duties on oil and petroleum products with increasing MET taxes on raw
materials extraction to compensate for possible losses to companies, and to stabilise
the domestic market. It was decided to introduce a reverse excise tax, which
means that some of the earnings from oil wells or increasing MET taxes will be redistributed
to the oil refiners and thus the situation on the motor fuel market, including diesel
and petroleum products, will stabilise.</p><p>But this was not enough, so the government
had to react to growing fuel prices manually and quickly (the entire country
was watching).</p><p>We came up with another mechanism:
companies are refunded some of the earnings they could have gained if they had sold
oil and petroleum products on the external market. We have agreed that this
year the cut-off price would be $55 per barrel; and the difference will be subsidised
from the budget, and if the price of oil drops, the oil companies will have to return the money to the budget, and the budget will be used to fund its own items
accordingly, including social funding. Next year the price is forecast to be
$50, I believe, for a barrel of oil.</p><p>Why am I going on about this, what
is the problem? The problem is that these stabilisation measures in the domestic
market did not include aviation fuel; it is as simple as that. Motor fuel was
included, diesel and all fuels, but aviation fuel was not. Last year the price increased
by 9.5 percent, so it grew by 30 percent for aviation fuel, and by 9.5 percent
for airfare, on average. This has never happened before. Growth was typically 2
percent annually. And now we see almost 10 percent, 9.5 percent or even a bit
more.</p><p> For example, 30 percent of the ticket price at Aeroflot
is the cost of fuel. I have discussed this with the government; with those
people in the government who are responsible for this, and I would like to remind them that this has been neglected and it must be adjusted. This goes for aviation fuel and for bitumen as well, because we need to build roads, and if
we do not do this, the cost of road construction will skyrocket as high as airplanes fly, and we will be unable to implement our road construction plans.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>Thank you, Gorno-Altaisk. Let us hear from other guests of the studio.</p><p>Valeria Korableva, please.</p><p><b>Valeria Korableva: </b>Mr President, if you do not mind I would like to ask about international
issues.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, please.</p><p><b>Valeria Korableva:</b> We have spoken about sanctions today and there is a man in our studio who
is living under them. Let me introduce him. He is the winner of the Leaders of Russia contest of managers, Yevgeny Grabchak. His question is about the leader
of the country imposing these sanctions, Donald Trump. Considering that the G20
summit is about to take place, let us hear your question.</p><p><b>Yevgeny Grabchak:</b> Thank you.</p><p>Mr President, I have been under individual
sanctions for several years now. This is why I am so interested in international affairs, international diplomacy. The US President has lately been
engaged in a strange diplomatic game: Twitter diplomacy. This is what my question
relates to. He wrote on Twitter more than once that he would very much like to meet with you. Do you want to meet with him? And if you do, do you think the meeting
will benefit this country in any way? Is he capable of improving our bilateral
relations?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Dialogue is always good. There is always need for it. And, of course, if
the US is interested in it – I have said this many times – we are open to dialogue to the extent that our partners are.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/5MA3K2vQJTBulEESZs512Vi14AuqAWWH.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/NfB7BTtJXYvuvUiTGI6Qv3Ibk5m2JLtk.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(30, 51, 254);background:linear-gradient(0deg, #1e33fe 0%, rgba(30,51,254,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #e0a590 0%, rgba(224,165,144,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #b18179 0%, rgba(177,129,121,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #4a2039 0%, rgba(74,32,57,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>However, we understand, we see what is
happening in US domestic politics. Even if the President wants to meet us halfway
in some respects, wants to talk about something, there is a host of restrictions related to the actions of other government institutions. This is especially
true now that the incumbent President will be keeping one eye on the demands of the election campaign that he has already started. </p><p>So I believe not everything will be simple
in our relations, considering that part of the US establishment is exploiting Russia-US
relations, trying to catch something for itself in this turbid water and inventing, as was mentioned here, groundless fakes by exerting efforts that are
worthy of better use. And on and on, always the same. </p><p>Therefore, as soon as our colleagues
are ready we will respond accordingly, all the more so since we have a lot to discuss in international security and disarmament. I am referring to the New START
Treaty that is about to expire and, in general, to the need to cultivate normal
interstate relations in all areas, including the economy. </p><p>After all, US companies are not leaving
the Russian market. They are working on it although the turnover is not big. But,
as I have already said, under Trump our trade grew by $5 billion. It fell under
Obama to $20 billion but under Trump, it increased despite all the restrictions
and sanctions.</p><p>As for sanctions, I think this is a big
mistake on the part of the US. I hope they realise this eventually and fix it. </p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b>
We have been working in conditions of cyber attacks today; meanwhile The New
York Times reported that US intelligence agencies are trying to penetrate Russia’s
power grid. President Trump even accused them of treason. Anyhow, these are
their problems, while we are left wondering if it is indeed possible to switch
off the lights across the whole of Russia from inside US territory. Do they
have such a switch?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>You know, the modern world is very interconnected and interdependent. I certainly heard about the article in the New York Times and saw the President’s
reaction, calling them traitors.</p><p>I am not sure how we should interpret
that – if it means that they disclosed real information or it was a planted
story. But in any case, we have to respond one way or another; we must
understand what this is about. </p><p>This is
what I want to say on this matter. First, we suggested a number of times to our American partners that we should begin a dialogue to develop some rules in cyberspace including those affecting
critical infrastructure and mass media, but we have yet to get any rational response from them.</p><p>At the outset of his political career President Obama seemed to agree with that but he
subsequently did not have time to do anything about it. We also informed the current administration about it. The response was generally positive but it did
not go any further either.</p><p>As to the operation of our critical infrastructure including power and other areas, we
must certainly think about how to protect ourselves from any cyber attacks,
from any negative impact. We are not only contemplating this but also addressing it. </p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> Let us get back to our call centre.</p><p><b>Natalya Yuryeva:</b> Thank you, colleagues.</p><p>Russia has
made a tremendous technological breakthrough in modern weaponry – there is the new Armata missile system, the hypersonic Kinzhal, the prospective Avangard
missile system, laser weapons. All of this is certainly very impressive. We are
proud of these achievements, yet at the same time, it makes us worry.</p><p>We have a video call on this topic. The caller is Alexander Batrakov of Moscow.
Alexander, you are on the air, we are awaiting your question.</p><p><b>Alexander Batrakov:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President. </p><p>Why does TV
show so many new weapons?
For which war and with which adversary are we being prepared?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Actually, it makes sense to remember what the ancients taught us: If
you want peace, prepare for war. There is another famous maxim: Those who do not want to feed their
army will feed that of their enemy.</p><p>This is what I would like to say
generally. Firstly, Russia is not among the leaders in military spending. Look,
the USA is way ahead of us as they spend, if I am not mistaken, $720, and now
they are asking for an astounding $750 billion.</p><p>The People’s Republic of China comes
second with $117 billion in spending. It is followed by Saudi Arabia, imagine
that, which overtook us, Great Britain, France, Japan, and then Russia in seventh place in absolute terms, I think we are at the equivalent of $48
billion. The most curious thing is that we are the only great military power –
and this is true – that is cutting military spending.</p><p>In 2017 it accounted for 3.4 percent
of the GDP (that is a lot for us), however, in 2018 it was slightly above three
percent, in 2019 below three (2.9 percent). It will be 2.87 next year and 2.8
by 2021. If I am mistaken it is only on the decimals, but there is a trend of cutting
military expenditures. No other big country is doing this, not a single one.</p><p>What is curious and what we should certainly
pay attention to and take pride in is that despite the modest military spending
we not only maintain military and nuclear parity, but we are also two to three
steps ahead of our competitors, because no other country in the world has the cutting-edge weapons technology that we have, I mean our hypersonic missiles.</p><p>This is something we should also take
note of. This is a fact that should make us feel proud of our country and feel
respect for the people working in defence and research, the defence industry,
and for those people who are working to build up our military, who organise that
process. We should take note and thank them for it.</p><p>I read another message here which states, and quite correctly, that the power of a country in the modern world lies not so much in the Poseidons and Peresvets or other weapons as in its economic power. </p><p> This is absolutely true, and this is the reason we organise
work under national projects, so as to support our economic power. </p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> I also have a message that is somewhat military related.</p><p>A young
girl writes from Ivanovo:
My name is Darya Rogozina; I am 13. I would like to serve the Motherland as a naval officer but unfortunately, girls are not admitted to the Nakhimov School,
at least, not yet. </p><p>We have a different story in Krasnodar.
On direct line is…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I am sorry to interrupt you now.</p><p>I think
regarding the Nakhimov School, a decision is
being considered for the possible enrollment of young women. </p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> Then we will tell Darya that she will have to wait. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I believe a new location has been designated
for this, and other things, in St Petersburg. I may be wrong but having said this,
I hope Minister Shoigu will respond. </p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> That is exactly how it is going to be …</p><p>I suggest

It is also
called “a flying desk” for future pilots.</p><p>We all
remember the lyrics of the song: “Airplanes always come first, and girls only
afterwards.” But it sounds somewhat insulting for today’s heroes because you
see these charming young women are cadets at the training centre, and they
dream of the Aerospace Forces.</p><p>And many of them also hope to ask a question of their Supreme Commander. Just like that,
because even though these young women are still cadets, they have already tied
their lives to military service. So let us begin.</p><p>Hello, will
you please introduce yourself and ask the President your question.</p><p><b>Alla Sankova:</b> Good afternoon, Mr Supreme Commander-in-Chief.</p><p>I am Alla
Sankova, a cadet at the Krasnodar Air Force School. To begin with, allow me to express my gratitude from all the female cadets at our school to you and the Defence Ministry for the opportunity to study and pursue the profession of a military pilot.</p><p>Will you
please tell us if we will be able to participate in other forms of aviation
besides military transport? For example, fighter jets or assault aviation. I think we are as capable as the men are.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I think your wonderful, beautiful
braid will fit in a combat helmet. And I do not see any restriction that could impede
your service in the Aerospace Forces, in its various forms including fighter planes.
There are no physiological restrictions for women, and I believe there should
not be any. </p><p>The only
thing I would like you to consider is assault aviation. The loads there are
unbelievable. When I myself flew on a fighter jet, and afterwards on assault
jets, I can tell you this: fighter aviation – yes, it now has long-range
weapons, they are aviation complexes that require a very high level of professional
training. Why can’t women master it? Of course, they can. </p><p>As to assault aviation, where a pilot flies as he watches with his own eyes the developments in a battle, it involves constant loads up and down, up and down. I am puzzled as to how men fly these planes because the only
thing that moves is their fingers, they are so pressed into the chair that they
cannot move their heads, cannot move anything, they only operate with their
fingers. I am amazed at how they do it. </p><p>This is why
I feel you must explore everything and then move to assault aviation. But,
again, I do not see any limitations here. The specialists and medics must be
consulted. However, let me repeat for the third time, there is nothing
inaccessible for women in military service.</p><p><b>Question:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President. I am a cadet of the Krasnodar Air Force Academy. Your life involves constant flying. How far do
you fly annually?</p><p>I also have
a very interesting question: would a woman be considered to be one of your
plane’s crew members?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Of course, she can, probably. But let me remind you that I use Rossiya Airlines aircraft which are
not part of the Aerospace Forces. That is one thing.</p><p>The second,
regarding the distance travelled. It is a lot, I do not remember, but from 2012
until now… It is hard to say, but if I count how long I was in the air, maybe it
would be months of just flight time.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> Thank you, Krasnodar. </p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> On with the military theme. The situation in Syria
seems to be quieter. Will there be a big deal with America?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>What do you mean by “a deal”? This is not a commercial enterprise.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> These days, deal is used to call anything …</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>No, we do not do deals involving our allies or our interests or our principles. We can agree with our partners on resolving
certain urgent issues.</p><p>Some of the problems that we must address
together, primarily with our colleagues with whom we have made tangible progress,
that is, Turkey, Iran, and other countries involved in the conflict, and above all
the US, are related to the political settlement and the formation of the constitutional
committee, the rules governing its work and getting that work underway. </p><p>Can this be done or not? I think it
can, given the goodwill of all stakeholder countries. I have already named them,
but there are more countries in the region that are involved, primarily Israel,
Egypt, and the European countries that are suffering from the flow of migrants
and have a stake in securing a settlement. To sum up, we must pool our efforts
and work together. </p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b>
To continue the topic, one more foreign policy question from Odnoklassniki. I quote:
“The US blamed Iranians of attacking tankers on the Gulf of Oman. Will there be
war between America and Iran” – they are asking you for some reason – “and what
will Russia do?” </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> You said it – it is unclear why they are asking me. Probably because
there is no Direct Line with my colleagues from Iran and other countries. We do
not know the answer but of course, we would not welcome a war. That said, the US says it is not ruling out the use of force, either.</p><p>I would like to say straight out that
this would be, at a minimum, a catastrophe for the region, because it would
lead to an outbreak of violence and maybe to an increase in the flow of refugees from this region.</p><p>But I think this would probably also
have terrible consequences for those who would hazard such attempts because it is
very difficult to calculate what the use of force may lead to. This is very difficult
to foresee.</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/p5eGn0rFJqiU52VG7CSS1h5M2GA6MtCk.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/QwgW9ZYYXLIgjxt9gdDzLlm7joezWajt.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(90, 96, 110);background:linear-gradient(0deg, #5a606e 0%, rgba(90,96,110,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #94a5b5 0%, rgba(148,165,181,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #3b434e 0%, rgba(59,67,78,0) 100%),linear-gradient(90deg, #b3c0d0 0%, rgba(179,192,208,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>This is because Iran is a Shiite country

He has been raising his hand from the beginning.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Yes, yes.</p><p><b>Maria Gladkikh: </b>What is your question to the President?</p><p><b>Ilya Kovalyov: </b>Mr President, good afternoon. I am the head of the autonomous non-governmental
organisation Investment Agency for the Social Sphere. We are working on several
projects, such as <i>Football Russia</i>.
The project includes building year-round covered arenas at universities and schools. For example, there is a school with a worn out football pitch. We
build a covered all-season arena on this worn pitch. The budget is not paying
for this, neither is the school, nor the region; they do not pay for construction or maintenance.</p><p>Over the last three years, we have
built 23 arenas like this across Russia. After a while, we realised that the programme
was paying for itself and that it should be used elsewhere. </p><p><b>Maria Gladkikh: </b>What is your question? A bit shorter, if you please.</p><p><b>Ilya Kovalyov:</b>
So, we realised that the programme should be replicated. The Sports Ministry
supports this, and the head of the corporation for the development of small and medium businesses Alexander Braverman found the model economically viable and supported it, too. However, later we found that there were strict
administrative obstacles, in particular, in Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities
with a million-plus population. This means that our contracts cannot be approved
even at a low level, even though we are not demanding money. Mr President, this
is what people at the lower levels are saying; I am not talking about top
managers or governors: why would we need private investment if we have budget
funding?</p><p>What would we like to ask of you? To see how this project is being implemented. We can explain and show how it is
done in Moscow, for example, and how to support similar projects. We would like
to cooperate with the Russian Football Union, or someone we has not dealt with so
far, to work on this issue and do it in Moscow, St Petersburg and other large
cities. This is our request and proposal.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I will speak with my colleagues, with Mr Sobyanin [Moscow Mayor], the Acting Governor of St Petersburg and others. As far as I can see, the main
thing for us is to provide for the continuous, high-quality operation of educational institutions.</p><p>You need to cover your expenses,
which means that you have an idea how to use these facilities commercially. It
is important that this use does not interfere with the operation of the schools
or universities. But I will definitely speak with my colleagues.</p><p>Overall, I believe that this is a very good thing to do, and this would promote competition between schools. You
know, this is well-developed in some countries: competitions between
universities and schools. This is a very good area of work.</p><p><b>Ilya Kovalyov: </b>Mr President, children in the morning…</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin: </b>Yes, I can guess. Access is free in the morning and for a fee in the evening. It is important that the morning does not end at 10.00 at night. We should discuss all this with our colleagues. I will do this,
I promise. They have probably heard this and will respond.</p><p><b>Maria Gladkikh:</b> Mr President, let us move from football on to culture because of a major event of the week.</p><p>Practically
all my friends, without exaggeration, have already visited the remarkable
exhibition that is currently running at the Pushkin Fine Arts Museum, while I have
been too busy with work to be able to, though hopefully I will make it before long.
The exhibition features Sergei Shchukin’s full collection of paintings. Nothing
of the sort has ever taken place before.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Good. We will get back to the Pushkin Museum
in a moment.</p><p>There was an SMS regarding salaries in emergency medicine. I would ask Ms Skvortsova to look
into how things stand in the regions, given that the name of the region is
indicated in the SMS. We must see what the salaries are in emergency medicine. </p><p>Please go ahead.</p><p><b>Maria Gladkikh:</b> Next to me is Director of the Pushkin Museum Marina
Loshak. I suggest giving her the floor. </p><p>Ms Loshak,
thank you for such an interesting exhibition. It was enough for me to learn
about it on the internet to get excited about this historic event. What is your
question? </p><p><b>Marina Loshak:</b> You know, yesterday we unveiled an exhibition that
is something of a landmark in the history of Russian culture. The exhibition acquaints
visitors with an outstanding Russian citizen, collector and philanthropist, who
played a huge role in the textile business and donated money for the upkeep of hospitals and schools, a man whose name is celebrated in Russian history. </p><p>His home is
located close to our museum. It was formerly the palace of the Trubetskoy family,
who invited him to stay with them at their home. Hanging on the palace walls
were 50 Picassos, 38 Matisses and 16 Gauguins from his time in Tahiti, the best
of Monet and the best works of 20<sup>th</sup>-century French art. The Shchukin
exhibition in Paris three years ago drew a record 1.25 million visitors who queued
at the museum from dawn till dusk and could not believe that the best works by French impressionism – the pride of the 20<sup>th</sup> century – were to be
found in Russia. </p><p>As I speak
now I feel that Shchukin is standing behind me and I am speaking on his behalf.
His home is not seen as a cultural landmark and, in my view, it is very
important that it be given this status. It is not important whether our museum or the Hermitage or some other museum manages it, but it must be part of the culture
because it is a historical landmark in which we are greatly interested, as this
is exactly the kind of memory that cements our society and our nation together,
which seems very important to me.</p><p>So my question is as follows: can the dream of the director of the museum and of a million-strong army of museum visitors ever – I do not know when exactly – come
true?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Can we createa Shchukin
museum there?</p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/Ct7bHAbLoGrivt9fsAZCesiwLzbxGGB3.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/LoqMGO7GA6sHMmbwC1vPeIcAZBNGrLMf.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(48, 34, 27);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #30221b 0%, rgba(48,34,27,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #8d8482 0%, rgba(141,132,130,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #0f98e1 0%, rgba(15,152,225,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #cce1e4 0%, rgba(204,225,228,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p><b>Marina Loshak: </b>We can create a museum in the spirit of Shchukin. There are many
solutions and options.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Could you name one?</p><p><b>Marina Loshak:</b>
One option is a Shchukin family museum because all three brothers, except
Sergey, were great collectors and benefactors. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I see. Where? There, in his house? </p><p><b>Marina Loshak:</b>
It is a small house at 18 Bolshoi Znamensky Lane.</p><p><b>Maria Gladkikh:</b> This building belongs to the Ministry of Defence. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, of course.</p><p><b>Maria Loshak:</b>
Since 1941.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes. I understand what you mean now. I will go by what I have seen with
my own eyes, if you do not mind. Is it the one on the right-hand side on the way to the Kremlin? </p><p><b>Marina Loshak:</b>
Exactly. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Behind an iron fence. </p><p>Yes, it is a building complex that
belongs to the Ministry of Defence, where Ministry of Defence departments are
located and where communication systems were installed after 1941. This area
and these spaces were developed by the Ministry of Defence. </p><p>The Ministry has been developing the infrastructure year after year, for decades. I believe people understand what the infrastructure of a military establishment entails. It is primarily
communication systems and they are expensive. </p><p>Still, we can give them time to think it over. I believe that the first step could be to instruct the Ministry
of Defence, and I hope the Minister can hear me, to consider the option of how
the Defence Ministry itself… </p><p>Because the building is part of its
premises and so as not to uproot the Ministry from its property and hand it
over to the City Council or the Ministry of Culture but to leave it for the Ministry of Defence, it would make sense if the Ministry of Defence oversaw this
work itself and opened a Shchukin Museum there. </p><p><b>Marina Loshak:</b>
We could also participate…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>:
Not only you.</p><p><b>Marina Loshak:</b>
We are very much interested in this. </p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Under the supervision and with the direct assistance of the Ministry of Culture, with your participation and according to the Defence Ministry’s plans
and designs, and so on. </p><p> The more so because this kind of activity seems to be far outside the scope of the Ministry of Defence at first sight, though the Ministry has a department like the Grekov Studio of Military Art. Therefore, in general, this is nothing out of the ordinary and the Ministry of Defence is in a position to do this and can afford it. </p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: Mr President, the producers are
telling me we are ready to connect to the village of Kaskara in the Tyumen Region,
where there is no water. We sent a film crew there at the beginning of our Direct
Line. Let's see what is happening there.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Just a moment.</p><p>I just read some interesting information here.
“Yeltsin realised at the time – it was written – that Primakov absolutely had
to head the Government. Do you think it necessary for Mr Grudinin to head the Government now?”</p><p>Primakov did not have bank accounts abroad; he
was not engaged in business. Yevgeny Primakov was an absolutely clear and transparent person. Therefore, before making such personnel decisions, as proposed, one needs to think carefully. A candidate will have to withdraw money
from offshore companies – for a start.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: Could you please show the Tyumen Region
on the screen.</p><p>Artur Mikhailov is ready to start the videoconference.</p><p><b>Artur Mikhailov</b>: Hello, we are in the village of Kaskara. It is not far from the regional centre, about 20–30 minutes by car. We
got there quickly and had time to talk with local residents, including Maria
Kuznetsova, who sent the video message.</p><p>Here is the problem in a nutshell, so that
everyone understands. Water is available in Kaskara, but Kaskara is quite a big
and old village, more than 10,000 people. So in the old part, the water quality
is okay for drinking. But in the new developments, mostly low-rise areas, which
are home to over 3,000 people, there is no water supply. People use wells, and even
go to Tyumen to get their drinking water. This is rather inconvenient.</p><p>But local residents believe the solution to the problem is literally under their feet. We are now standing in the place where a water pipe is buried. We are here together. The local residents will better explain
where it leads. They also know better how acute the problem is. By the way, the local authorities have just arrived at the site, and a debate is unfolding, of which we were witnesses.</p><p> I suggest we let them talk now. Everyone is present
here – the local authorities and Maria Kuznetsova, the local resident who sent the video. Hello! The President can hear you.</p><p><b>Maria Kuznetsova:</b> Good afternoon, Mr President.</p><p>We have a big favour to ask of you. Please help
us with our water supply. We have lived in this village for 20 years, and we
still do not have running water. They make new promises every year, but we are
still waiting for them to deliver on their promises.</p><p><b>Artur Mikhailov:</b> I see that you have brought water
bottles with you. What kind of water is this?</p><p><b>Maria Kuznetsova:</b> It is the water we get after
four-stage purification. We use it to make tea. Look at it. Our children have
to drink this cloudy water, because the only other choice is to buy bottled
water or to travel 15 kilometres to obtain clean water. </p><div class="media masha-ignore"> <figure class="media__pic" itemscope="itemscope" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><img src="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big/8aiJA6KG9mV5GY8DGwdqAhpht2DxeTRy.jpg" srcset="http://static.kremlin.ru/media/events/photos/big2x/IoMUge0k4RDn9zcESgkkNQqRA9EGVvh7.jpg 2x" style="background:rgb(152, 160, 181);background:linear-gradient(90deg, #98a0b5 0%, rgba(152,160,181,0) 100%),linear-gradient(270deg, #2f3044 0%, rgba(47,48,68,0) 100%),linear-gradient(0deg, #4a5e86 0%, rgba(74,94,134,0) 100%),linear-gradient(180deg, #6b5456 0%, rgba(107,84,86,0) 100%);" width="940" height="580" alt="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin." itemprop="contentUrl" class="image"><meta itemprop="name" content="Direct Line with Vladimir Putin."><meta itemprop="datePublished" content="2019-06-20"></figure><span class="media__title player__title">Direct Line with Vladimir Putin.</span> </div><p>Moreover, our village is located in direct

located. It is barely one kilometre away from here.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> In other words, a branch pipeline
should be built from the intake system. Is this the case?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> How far is the village located from
the regional centre?</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> It is only 20 kilometres away.</p><p><b>Maria Kuznetsova:</b> We travel to our relatives in the nearby village to wash our children and to do our washing.</p><p><b>Remark:</b> The water is yellow.</p><p><b>Maria Kuznetsova:</b> We have to sink individual artesian
or other water wells.</p><p><b>Remark: </b>This is what I would like to say. We
have lived here for a long time, and every one of us had to sink water wells.
They have promised to connect us to the water system by 2020. We would greatly
appreciate this.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> We see your problem. Let us listen
to what the President has to say about this.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Ok, I understand your problem.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> There are members of the local
authorities there. Shall we give them the floor?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Please, do.</p><p><b>Oleg Podenov:</b> Good afternoon. I am Oleg Podenov,
and I live in this village. </p><p>At present, I get water from an artesian well.
A new water supply system is scheduled to be built in 2020 or 2021. It will be
connected to the new buildings of Kaskara. We are preparing the documents and discussing the plans. I believe people can wait for a year or two…</p><p><b>Remark:</b> We have waited 10 years…</p><p><b>Oleg
Podenov:</b> …and then they will have clean drinking water. As of now, we are preparing the documents. They will be approved by the local
legislature after discussions, that is, if it was not discussed 10 years ago.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: Let's listen to the President.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Yes. What our colleague said just
now is also relevant; this is important information. I take it that the village
is not far from the regional centre – 20 minutes or 20 kilometres, as you said,
but very near anyway. There is a water main there. Unfortunately, this is a problem across the country. Unfortunately, millions of people do not have
access to quality drinking water. We have a whole programme to ensure that
people have access to clean and quality water.</p><p>In this particular case, it sounds a little
strange to me that the place is in close proximity to a large and self-sufficient regional centre. Tyumen is one of the donor regions, and there is
quite enough money there to resolve such problems. I do not know if there is an objective reason to wait for a year or two to do this. Honestly, I doubt it. In any case, to build a water discharge system in the next two years would not
cost that much. Let us hear what the governor has to say. Go ahead please.</p><p><b>Tyumen Region Governor
Alexander Moor</b>:
Good afternoon, Mr President,</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Good afternoon.</p><p><b>Alexander Moor</b>: Indeed, supplying water to residents of the Tyumen Region has always been monitored by both the Governor and the government of the Tyumen Region.</p><p> As for Kaskara, indeed, the village does have a centralised water supply. The supply system was built a long time ago, in 1974,
when the local poultry farm was built, and until recently it was managed by this
poultry farm. Earlier this year, it was transferred to the management of the Tyumen
Vodokanal water and wastewater services
provider, because water is supplied to Kaskara from the centralised system of the city of Tyumen. So today, anyone can apply for a technical
connection, and this opportunity will be provided to them. The system is indeed
quite old, as the residents said today. We are reconstructing the water supply
system not only with government money, but also by attracting investor funds
through concessions. Three years ago, in the city of Tyumen, we concluded one
of the largest concession deals in Russia, for 23 billion, and now we are
working on another concession, planned for September-October, involving the entire Tyumensky district – and Kaskara is part of this district, to provide
not only Kaskara, but also other villages in the district with centralised
water supply and wastewater disposal systems.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: So when will there be water?</p><p><b>Alexander Moor</b>: It was announced at a local
meeting that it would be in 2020, and one of the meeting participants, as I understand it, wanted to say just that. The water line from the city of Tyumen
to Kaskara will be built, and it will be possible to increase the volume and throughput
capacity of that line, so all the residents of small house suburbs will be
connected to the centralised water supply. Absolutely no problems here, the question is clear.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: So they will have water in 2020, right?
Mr Governor, water in 2020, have we understood correctly?</p><p><b>Alexander Moor</b>: The water supply system will be modernised
in 2020. But applications for connection can be submitted even now, because the management has been transferred from the poultry farm to a professional market player,
Tyumen Vodokanal.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: You can consider the application already
in place. That is what people are talking about. So you need to do it right
now, not postpone it.</p><p><b>Alexander Moor</b>: We need to apply to Tyumen
Vodokanal, and the connection will be made.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: Do it. This is as good as done. I have
just applied on their behalf. I am asking you – do it as quickly as possible.
Agreed?</p><p><b>Alexander Moor</b>: We will do it, Mr President.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin</b>: I hope this will be done.</p><p>In general though, I would like to tell my colleagues, the governors, that they must, of course, join programmes that are
being implemented at the Federation level. But they need to use modern water
purification methods. We have large enterprises, including those in the defence
industry, and one of them, MITT, the Moscow Institute of Thermal Technology, has
made a remarkable discovery, a water purification invention, and it is working
effectively. But they cannot expand into the regions. I am pointing out to my colleagues in the regions that they need to use such technologies, including
the one I have mentioned.</p><p> As for this specific case, I am asking you to resolve
it as quickly as possible.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> It is a striking example, but there are many more such examples. It appears that no matter what happens through the fault of village, city or regional heads, you are the one who is held accountable. Is it frustrating for you? Many new governors have been appointed this year. Has this produced any positive effect?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> This must not frustrate me, because this is my job. I have already said somewhere in the middle of this programme that I feel responsible, in part, for the fact that some of the goals set are not achieved. Of course, I will not turn a blind eye to the failures of ministries, departments or regional authorities. Our colleagues must be held responsible for the range of subjects that are directly within their competence.</p><p>I have seen a scrolling line here that said, “Is Direct Line a special services’ show?” I know that it is a loaded question. I can assure you that none of Russia’s special services has anything to do with today’s programme.</p><p>You saw how I was preparing for today’s event, this Direct Line. Questions started coming in a long time ago, and the direction of these questions and the topics that are the biggest concern for the people were clear to me. However, this is a direct line to the nation, to our citizens, a direct line that is intended to bring the bottlenecks into focus and to find solutions to these problems, the possible methods of dealing with them, sometimes right on the spot, during our dialogue.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> Mr President, many programmes have been launched in the past few years to help talented young people. We have a representative of the Leaders of Russia contest. Is this contest an effective instrument?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Yes, I believe that it is an effective project. The Leaders of Russia is not the only project of this kind. By the way, we received over 200,000 applications for this contest. Overall, we received more than one million, or more precisely, 1.5 million applications for various sourcing and training projects.</p><p>As for this social lift project, the Leaders of Russia, it is an effective project.

I do not consider them to be minor if they affect human lives.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>One more question: “All of us know
how hard you work. Do you ever feel lazy? How do you fight this feeling?” This
question is from a school student Danila Karyakin.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> First, psychologists say, if I am
not mistaken, that feeling lazy is a normal human state that overcomes people
when the body feels it needs to take a break. You should learn to give yourself
time to rest. But the only method of fighting laziness is to start working.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> How can you force yourself to work?</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> There is an interesting film, “The President’s Vacation”…</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Sorry, but I see a hand raised
there. Please.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> We will take a microphone over there.</p><p><b>Natalya Kaspersky:</b> Mr President, I am Natalya
Kaspersky, President of the InfoWatch group of companies.</p><p>My question: What do you plan to do in light of the Huawei scandal, attacks on Venezuela’s energy system and the recent item in The New York Times regarding possible US cyberattacks on Russia’s electricity
power grid? How can we boost the import substitution programme in this sphere,
because it is clear that we seriously depend on these imports and the substitution project is marking time?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I see. I have already spoken on this subject, but I can mention it again. We are working on import
substitution. As I have said, we have allocated some 667 billion rubles for this, including for the high-tech sectors of the national economy.</p><p>But the key idea I want to repeat once again is
that we must protect the critically important infrastructure sectors, including
with the assistance of such companies as yours. We are trying to do this. We
need to create an internal market for such products. We will be encouraging
this, even if we have to resort to non-market methods.</p><p><b>Natalya Kaspersky:</b> We need to provide assistance to the procurers, because companies and corporations are reluctant.</p><p><b>Vladimir
Putin:</b> I understand. We do not so much need to support
the procurers as, much as I dislike the word, force them to do what we want. We
must encourage them to buy Russian products. We are pondering the possibilities
here. I have issued instructions to the Government. We will continue working on this.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>I have been informed that Governor Uss, governor of the Krasnoyarsk Territory,
arrived in the microdistrict with no infrastructure at all. We can put him on now, if you see fit. We can see what is happening there. Let’s have a look.</p><p><i>(A fragment of a meeting is shown on the screen.)</i></p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>I don’t know if they can hear us, but we can see that work is in full

on to the guests in the studio?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Let’s have some questions from the audience, we have already been
talking for four hours.</p><p><b>Yegor Beroyev: </b>I will try to be quick.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Go on please.</p><p><b>Yegor Beroyev: </b>Yegor Beroyev; I am an actor and co-founder of the I Am charity
foundation.</p><p>We work with mentally special
people: with Down syndrome, autism, other wonderful special needs which you are
aware of. I would like to speak with you about psychoneurological care
facilities. The head of such an institution is simultaneously the client, the service
provider and the sole guarantor of the services provided. This results in a direct conflict of interests.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>A client and a service provider? How is that?</p><p><b>Yegor Beroyev: </b>Yes, a client and a service provider.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I have no idea what they can provide.</p><p><b>Yegor Beroyev: </b>Everything possible. They are the only caretakers for people living in these care homes. This means there is a system, and it’s completely corrupt.</p><p>In 2017, in Petrozavodsk, you
instructed your colleagues to reform the system, but regional officials
completely sabotaged your instructions; and adoption of the law on distributed guardianship
is our only hope now. You know this law very well. Both the government and the State
Duma have been trying to adopt this law for two years now.</p><p>Now the law is hindered by the State-Legal Directorate of the Presidential Executive Office. We cannot
understand its reasoning in this situation. All our hopes today are on you.</p><p>I can assure you that society needs
this law, because, well, I have been working for eight years and have travelled
across Russia with my colleagues; we know that people are living as if they
were in prison. These people have no joy in life like we do. They share underwear,
they share toothbrushes; they cannot go outside. We must solve this problem.
Society needs this. We need them more than they need us.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Ok.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>Thank you.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I shall return to this.</p><p><b>Yegor Beroyev: </b>Please do.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I am sure that the Presidential Executive Office’s State-Legal
Directorate has no element of corruption and as you may be aware, personally
they are very far removed from this problem. If this is the case, there are some
substantive arguments, if there are any at all. Maybe it’s a simple
administrative issue. I promise you that I shall return to this subject.</p><p><b>Yegor
Beroyev: </b>Thank you.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>Mr President, should we continue with our quick questions?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Yes, please.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>Let’s continue.</p><p>“There is an interesting film titled

freely, unrecognised, but I understand that this is impossible. So I have to make do with real life.</p><p>Third, it is one thing to have a trip, even a long one like I once took in Zhiguli, travelling for 2,000
kilometres in the Far East and inspecting the road connecting Khabarovsk and Chita.</p><p>However, even if I go somewhere
unrecognised, it does not give me a full picture of the situation in Russia,
because you can only see specific places and specific situations, while our
country is large and not everything is concentrated in one place. It is
necessary to have information from different sources in order to understand
what is going on in Russia.</p><p>Third, I do travel across Russia and look. I can even, I am not afraid to mention this, see what is happening in the regions through the newly painted grass and benches. You know, I can see this.
That is why I will continue my trips, but I will have to take what holidays are
possible.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>We know you like jokes and often quote them. Do you know any about
yourself?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>Of course, I have heard a lot.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>Please tell one.</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>No. Now I have a colleague who does this professionally and much better
than I do. <i>(Laughter.)</i></p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin: </b>Viktor Mitrofanov, Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Area. “Officials inform you
about what they believe necessary, and it is often far from reality. Thus they
knowingly decrease your ratings and the public trust. When will you make them
stand by their words?”</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin: </b>I think that it is an exaggeration to say that all officials always
provide false information. Of course, this is not true. But perhaps it happens.</p><p>You know, to tell the truth, during
all these years in office, I have never seen anybody knowingly trying to misinform me. I cannot remember any such case.</p><p>Perhaps they are the ones who are
misinformed and they report their position to me when it is not objective; or their proposals regarding some problem are not the best solution. This can
happen and happens quite often.</p><p>But what
can we do in such a situation? We need to gather opinions from many sources and make decisions based on a consensus.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik:</b> “What is Russia’s greatest problem
now?”</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I spoke about this at the beginning
and in the middle of our conversation. Since the main goal we must achieve in several ways within the framework of our national projects is higher labour
efficiency, which we must use to improve the living standards of the people,
one of our biggest challenges is better labour efficiency. This is what we must
get down to.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin:</b> The topic of officials is very
popular. When will inefficient officials be replaced with robots?</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> Even if we decide to replace some
people with robots, we will need to ask the Kasperskys for assistance, we will
need to ask Yandex for help because you need people to program robots.</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik: </b>If there are any left.</p><p>“They are slinging mud at us, yet you call them
partners. Why are you so polite?”</p><p><b>Vladimir Putin:</b> I would not say I am very polite. However,
first of all, even though I grew up on the street, it was a street in St
Petersburg, where even the urban environment incites certain harmony. These are
not empty words; this is really so.</p><p>The urban environment and architecture are very
harmonious [in St Petersburg], and they are bound to influence human
development and our understanding of harmony. It is my first point.</p><p>Second, the Hermitage, the Russian Museum and the Tovstonogov Bolshoi Drama Theatre are all part of the environment in which
I grew up. Political culture is part of our culture as well. If it is missing
in some people, it is their problem.</p><p>Third, I represent Russia, which is a country
with a rich culture. I must never allow myself to forget this. </p><p>And lastly,
the fourth point. When the relationship between countries becomes critically
complex or turns sour, ties between these countries’ top officials are very
often the last resort for restoring relations, and this door must never be
shut. We must serve the interests of our nations. I must never forget this
either.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: Alexander Kuznetsov from

And it is not easy to talk about it to a multimillion audience. Of course I am,
like anyone else, like any normal person, I hope. I have already spoken about
this publicly.</p><p>Frankly speaking, it is even hard to talk about
it now, but still. It was in the early 2000s; I travelled a lot. The country
was going through a very difficult time. So we flew to one of the regions. It
was the end of the working day, late in the evening and dark.</p><p>It was autumn, and there was slush and mud
everywhere, and I was to walk some distance, walking in this slush to the car.
Suddenly, an elderly woman appeared in front of me, said something indistinctly
and suddenly fell to her knees, and gave me a note.</p><p>I promised her to read it. I took it, gave it
to the assistants, and it got lost. I will never forget this. I am still ashamed
of that. So now I try to carefully study everything that is sent or given to me.</p><p>You know, it’s not always possible to resolve problems.
Some are unsolvable. I am pretty sure, even certain, as to what was written in that note, having read dozens of such notes by now. Surely, something about
helping a son who is in prison, or something like that. But this is not the point;
the point is that it has been lost.</p><p><b>Pavel Zarubin</b>: Thank you. Shall we wrap up now?</p><p><b>Yelena Vinnik</b>: Mr President, maybe you wanted to answer
